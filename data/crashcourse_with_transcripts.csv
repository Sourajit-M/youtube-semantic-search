t6xLo1XYZZs,How is AI impacting society?: Crash Course Futures of AI #2,"AI is taking over…or is it? And what would that look like anyway? The smarter it gets, the better AI will become at doing– basically everything. That could lead us to a bright future, with booming economies and tons of free time for us human beings. But it could also lead us to something a lot darker. In order to prepare for that transition, we have to try and understand what it would really look like.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-11-26,2025,807,13.45,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6xLo1XYZZs,"It's 1764, Northwest England, 8:00 in the morning. Yes, this is still crash course, Futures of AI. Just stay with me. You put on your linen shift and petticoat and start your day at the neighborhood cottage core textile industry using your trusty spinning wheel to turn wool into thread. But today, your spinning wheel has been replaced by a new giant machine that can spin eight threads in the time it takes you to make one. It's called the spinning jenny, and in one fell swoop, it's revolutionized the textile industry and stolen your job. Wait, rapid technological advances replacing jobs? Where have I heard that before? Hi, I'm Kushian Avdar and this is Crash Course, Futures of AI. To help us understand exactly how it could transform our world, some researchers like to break down AI into levels. The first level is narrowly transformative AI. This is the kind of technology that could lead to practically irreversible change, but only in a specific area like the spinning jenny did for textiles. But some AI models have the potential to change all the most important aspects of our society. We call that second level transformative AI and it's on par with inventions like electricity and the internal combustion engine which you know transformed our entire world. And then there's another third level, a theoretical level that we're building up to that could make even bigger changes, ones we can't exactly imagine yet. radically transformative AI could impact not just our day-to-day lives, but how we measure progress, find worth, and think about our place in the world. Most people think AI with human level intelligence, known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, would be radically transformative. It's hard to predict when AGI will hit the streets or the cloud. Some people think we're really close, like a year or two away, but some others put that number closer to the year 2030 or even 2050. A small subset of people think we're centuries away from AGI, if we achieve it ever. But even without AGI, we're already in for some pretty big world restructuring. One really clear way we're seeing AI restructure our world already is in the economy. And to help us understand exactly how, the industrial revolution is probably the most helpful example. See, the industrial revolution saw a lot of manual labor become automated, done by fast, accurate machines like the spinning jenny, instead of slow, fallible humans like me. And automation turned out to be really good for the economy, mainly because it increased production, or the amount of stuff that could be made. That's because normally economies are limited by the amount of labor or workers they have available. But the spinning jenny and other industrial revolution era technologies helped industries scoot around that bottleneck and the era's economy absolutely exploded. These days, thanks to AI, machines don't just spin thread. They can design the clothes it gets made into, manage inventory at the store that sells them, run the algorithm that recommends them to you, and handle returns and exchanges when you call customer service. And it doesn't end with the textile industry. This is happening across tons of different markets. And just like all those centuries ago, that automation could be really good for our economy. Consider this. Our gross world product, the final market value of all the stuff created in the world's economy in a given year, usually grows by around two to 5% a year. But if AI keeps advancing the way it has been, some people predict that by 2100, our gross world product could be growing not by 5% but by as much as 30% every year. It's kind of unimaginable. And even though many economists are skeptical of this number, it's safe to say that this could potentially mean really big things for the economy. But just like back then, there's a dirty soot blackened flip side to the automation coin. What's good for the economy overall isn't always good for individual workers. The more jobs that get taken over by automation, the more human employees are pushed out of work. And that could change a lot more than how long it takes us to spin eight threads. Narrowly transformative AI is already changing the workforce. Since the 2000s, automation has taken over something like 1.7 million jobs from customer service to data entry to manufacturing to writing and editing. But not here on Crash Course. Don't worry, humans. And if AGI were to enter the chat, even more jobs or even entire professions would be cooked. AGI isn't here yet, but theoretically it would be able to do anything human cognition can. And it might even be able to do that work better than we can, transforming not only the economy, but all of human society in a way we're not ready for yet. But let's see it wear a top hat as well as I can. Like AGI could take over the entire workforce, restricting humans to narrow positions like AI oversight, which could be few and far between. And that's not even mentioning the environmental impacts of AGI. Even today's AI uses huge quantities of energy and water and pumps out huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Recent data suggests that the average AI data center consumes anywhere from 500,000 to several million gallons of water every day. And if AGI becomes ubiquitous, that number will probably skyrocket. All of which is going to exacerbate the pretty gnarly climate change we're already seeing, impacting not just the natural world, but our human communities, too. If the radical transformation happens slowly enough, and governments start planning for it, like now, we might have time to make it work, governments could introduce environmental standards that require energy usage to be transparent and push companies towards greener data centers. They're not currently where I sit in the US in 2025, but theoretically they could be. Governments could adopt structures like job guarantees that would keep us from being swapped out by AI. Or they could take things even further and adopt universal basic income to make sure people still have money even if our labor is replaced by machines. Or implement dividend schemes where humans would get small payouts from the profits AI makes. And that could be really transformative if AI takes humanity's place as the beast of burden for our economy. There's kind of no telling what we'd get up to. It could totally realign our values, our social structures, and and the ways we spend our time. It could change us from cogs in the capitalist machine into maybe something else. I might finally have time to catch them all. I'm at one. But if the transition happens too fast, without the proper safety nets, AGI could leave the majority of humanity unemployed, broke, and well, chat, cooked. Even if robots don't take over the whole workforce, these advances in AI could spell disaster for lots of regular people. One way this could happen is that the first people to develop AGI could get really powerful really fast. That could mean a single company starts to amass tons and tons of wealth, making the wealth inequality of 2025 look like chump change. And think about it on a governmental level. What if a single government could gain huge political, economic, and military advantages over all the other ones? The prospect of that huge advantage could lead to an AI arms race where countries, corporations, and maybe even extremist organizations hustle to build that super powerful AGI model first. All that stuff could be pretty bad news for most of humanity. It could concentrate wealth and influence in the hands of big companies like Microsoft or Google, billionaires like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, or greedy governments who don't always have the people's best interest in mind. It could be used to support authoritarianism around the globe. And I'm gonna level with you. That process is already starting. Deep fakes are images, videos, or audio recordings that can make it look like people are saying or doing things they didn't really say or do. They work like lots of other AI does, where neural networks train on tons and tons of data until they can start to generate new data that looks a lot like it. Only instead of chess games or novels, these neural networks train on faces, voices, and body language to learn how people look, sound, and move. And they can get pretty good at imitating people, like say US presidential candidates. In July of 2024, Musk himself shared a campaign video from Democratic candidate Kala Harris where she called herself a deep state puppet who's hiding her total incompetence. only Harris never said that. The video was a deep fake made by AI models trained on Harris's face and voice. And it was viewed over 100 million times. Deep fakes are an example of how AI can be used to influence voters, spread disinformation, and throw elections to those willing to play dirty. And it's not just political parties who are using AI to influence politics, but foreign nations, too. Lots of the deep fake content from the 2024 US election seems to have come from Russia, a country that might have some reasons to mess with the US's democracy. Deep fakes's actual impacts on voters aren't totally clear yet, but there is evidence that they've already influenced voter behavior, not only in the US, but also in countries like Slovakia, Indonesia, and India. And things could only get worse as deep fakes get more advanced, manipulating voters with disinformation, generating doubts around legitimate election results or convincing people not to vote at all. Messing with elections like that is a direct threat to democracy. And if AI can help people do it, then it could easily become a tool of authoritarianism, a pretty powerful one. And the more AI gets implemented in things like politics and economics, the more power it'll have in those systems, and the more it will be able to enforce the values of those potentially pretty evil groups who leverage it. This hypothetical situation is known as value lockin and it could leave us stuck with systems that are inequitable, anti-democratic, and a threat to human rights all supported by AI. So that all sounds scary, but it also kind of sounds like science fiction. While things like deep fakes are real and dangerous, radically transformative AI isn't actually here yet, and we can't be sure exactly how things will play out as we move into our AI future. Things could go down the radical road where AGI takes over our jobs and political systems, robbing us of what it means to be human or even going rogue and throwing off its human overlords entirely. And true, AI development has been increasing exponentially, blowing benchmarks and expert predictions out of the water faster than you can say, ""Alexa, how do you spell anti-isestablishmentarianism?"" All of which makes that robot takeover kind of scenario seem more and more likely by the day. But there are any number of other things that could happen too, making our AI future nothing more than a twinkle in Wall-E's melancholic robot eye. For instance, governments could intervene, taking action now to put a leash on things before they get too out of hand. Or we could start to run out of the new relevant highquality data that AI models need for training stalling progress. Or maybe AI development itself could end up slowing way down. And of course, there's always the possibility that AI just can't do as good a job as we think it can. So, the AI takeover could be fast and shocking, or it could never happen at all, or it could turn out the dolphins were behind everything all along. Anything is possible. But that doesn't mean we should get complacent. A long time ago, the spinning jenny probably sounded like science fiction, too. And if we look the other way for too long, we could end up trudging sadly home in our petty coats, choking on factory fumes, wondering if this is the end of life as we know it. But to really prepare for the possibilities of our AI future, we have to answer two really important questions. How powerful can AI become? And how quickly can it get there?

It's a beloved trope of westerns which go all the way back to the dawn of American cinema. In the 1890s, Thomas Edison used his new fangled kettocope to film Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, a sort of traveling rodeo that reenacted battles between American settlers and Native Americans. These depictions were far from accurate, but in a lot of ways, they're still with us. Why are these stereotypes so hard to shake? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] [Music] In its day, Buffalo Bill spun tales about savage warriors who were out for blood and noble tribal leaders who belong to a cartoonish mythical past. And these racist stereotypes made their way into the American Western movie, which was a problem for a lot of reasons, not least because for many Americans, the first and sometimes only time they saw indigenous people was on screen. And these flattened phony caricatures discouraged them from seeing native people, well, as people. Didn't I smash you already? For decades, Native American movie roles tended to fall into a few main tropes. Drunken Indians, aggressive warriors, magical healers, sage elders, and Indian princesses. Quick fact check, Indian princesses aren't even a thing, despite how many of them reach out to me on Instagram. Take the Oscar nominated film Stage Coach. It's a John Wayne western from the 1930s, and one of its main plot points is the constant threat of attack from the bloodthirsty Apache. Also, I just have to say that the Spanish came up with the name Apache. The tribe called themselves Inday or person or people. Anyway, there were a lot of these films, like a ton. Hollywood has made more than 4,000 movies about native people. And while native folks did get cast in a lot of these movies, they were typically relegated to uncredited background roles and paid a lot less. Meanwhile, the higherp paying native roles went to white people in Redface. That term is used to describe non-native people impersonating Native Americans, whether they use makeup to alter their complexion or not. But it also refers to this long-standing casting bias in Hollywood. And that bias went all the way down to costumes and props. Without native folks on set to advise on cultural practices, you wind up with everyone in feathered headdresses and buckskin, which is traditional clothing for the Plains Indians, but isn't for hundreds of other tribes. So it effectively flattened the massive diversity of native cultures into one smooshed together tribe. Not to mention that for many tribes including plays Indians feathers and war bonnets have deep spiritual significance that aren't meant for everyday wear or um Coachella. So yeah, the history of Native Americans in film was characterized by this terrible catch 22 where either Native actors got cast in demeaning roles that stereotype their identity or non-native actors got their jobs. Which brings us to a man who at the height of his fame was dubbed America's favorite Indian ironized Cody. His OG name was Aspera Oscar Decorti and he was born in 1904 in Louisiana. He wasn't native at all. His parents were both Italian immigrants and 20th century America wasn't a friendly place for them. Folks from places like Ireland and Italy faced a lot of racial prejudice because they weren't considered white at the time. Which isn't to say that's why Oscar decided to pose as Native American. But its context is worth mentioning. In the 1920s, Oscar and his two brothers moved to Hollywood to pursue film careers. And they anglicized their last name to Cody, a common practice at the time. At some point, Oscar started claiming that his father was Cherokee and his mother was Cree and that he grew up on a reservation in Oklahoma. Over the years, he slowly rose to fame, appearing in over 100 westerns and popular TV shows. Intentionally or not, he became Hollywood's and America's symbol of Native identity. But Ironized Cody was actually a pretend, someone who falsely claims Native American identity. And there's a long history of pretendians in the US, not just in Hollywood, but also in academia and politics. Take Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. For years, she publicly referenced her Cherokee heritage. After much criticism, she released the results of a DNA test that proved she did have a Native American ancestor about 10 generations ago. But as the Cherokee Nation pointed out in a statement, a drop of blood is not what makes someone Native. Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong, said Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. at the time. By the way, there's much more on tribal identity in episode 4. In any case, pretendants can cause real harm. They often take up resources that could otherwise be accessed by actual Native Americans while profiting off of historical and ongoing trauma while also misrepresenting us. For example, non-indigenous folks can get preferential treatment for scholarships and jobs by simply checking a box on an application, even sometimes going as far as to become wellrespected indigenous scholars who position themselves as authorities on native issues when in reality they have no claim to indigenous heritage or culture. But the whole concept of pretendians is also complicated. There's a danger to policing native identity which might discourage people who are generally trying to reconnect to their indigenous heritage after years of being violently disconnected from it. And it's up to each individual tribe to decide who belongs to them. And no broader governing body can do that job. No social media mob either. Because this type of belonging isn't just a roll call, it's a relationship. Like Kovville journalist Dena Helio Whitaker said in an interview, it's not just about your right to claim or to reconnect to that tribal identity. It's about what your responsibilities are to it. Ultimately, pretendianism is a form of cultural appropriation. When members of a dominant culture adopt symbols, arts, and ideas from historically disenfranchised cultures in a way that exploits, disrespects, or stereotypes them. And it happens everywhere all the time. Think those war bonnets at Coachella, the sports mascots, and the regrettable Halloween costumes. Compared to an allout identity theft, cultural appropriation can feel kind of subtle. Dressing up as Native American might not seem like a big deal since no one actually thinks a white person in a headdress is really claiming this heritage. But it's still harmful for a lot of reasons. For one, it separates the object from its specific cultural meaning. Like we talked about earlier, for many tribes, war bonnets are a symbol of honor. So wearing one to a music festival disrespects that cultural tradition. Also, just like the Hollywood westerns that collapse hundreds of distinct cultures into one stereotype, dressing up as Native American makes a caricature out of real living people. In fact, believing that Native Americans are a relic of the past can make non-natives think that those costumes aren't offensive. Hi again. Yep, still here. And not only are we still here, but the legacies of colonialism are still ongoing in our communities. As Cherokee writer and scholar Adrien Keane points out, dawning a headdress means contributing to the culture of power that continues to cycle today. Cultural appropriation can also apply to native inspired items such as dream catchers and jewelry. I get it. Our designs are dope. But when non-native folks profit off of those designs, it's not a good look. In fact, in some cases, it's illegal. Since 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act had made it illegal to market native products as such unless they're actually made by a Native American artist, which is great for both the creators and the consumers because the inauthentic dream catcher isn't going to do you any good. Trust me, those nightmares know a real one when they see one. Pretendianism and cultural appropriation can be messy and native folks don't always agree on where exactly the lines fall, which makes sense because contrary to the old cowboys and Indian stereotype, we're not all the same. But thankfully today, there are more natives than ever in all kinds of creative roles. And in Hollywood, we're not just increasingly represented on screen, we're also in the director's chair. Just look at the FX hit show Reservation Dogs. All of the writers, directors, and actors playing native characters are native folks. The show paints a funny, quirky, and authentic portrait of what life on a reservation is like. And then you've got examples of creative collaboration like Martin Scorsese's Oscar nominated movie Killers of the Flower Moon, starring Lily Gladstone of Crash Course film production fame. She has six tequipoo heritage and grew up on the Blackfoot reservation in Montana. Um, actually, hey ch, it's pronounced and nimi poo. Hundreds of natives were consulted for the movie, and according to Lily, it made a big difference. Our voices exist in community, she said in an interview. It's a lot to put on one person to be the voice for such a large body of a very diverse group of people. By the way, Lily also helped me out with our episode on indigenous women. So, there's been a lot of positive change since the heyday of the Hollywood western, and there's still a long way to go. But when native people get to tell our own rich and diverse stories, when we get to collaborate with each other and share our worldviews, our people, and our sense of humor, that's when the real movie magic happens. Next time we'll talk about traditional indigenous knowledge and how ecological practices from the past might just be the way forward. And I will see you then.

One guy who knew just how true that was, Raphael Trujillo, one of the crulest dictators in Latin American history. He bought into the idea that history was an official and singular story. So in order to control the Dominican people, he tried to take away the stories they told about themselves. Hi, I'm Kurly Velasquez and this is Crash Course Latin American Literature. [Music] The countries of Latin America are no strangers to authoritarianism. The kind of government that requires unquestioning loyalty and offers little individual freedom in return. Strong men, tyrants, and dictators have marked the region's history and literature for hundreds of years. So much so that a whole genre distinct to Latin American literature emerged around it. La nolla del dictador the dictator novel. These books offer something different from an officially sanctioned singular story. They give us multiple perspectives, critiques, and glimpses behind the scenes into people's everyday lives. Let's start in the 19th century. A lot of Latin America's trouble with tyrants stemmed from something unexpected. Geography. Seriously, this is such a big deal that there's a whole genre called nollas de laier, novels of the earth. And no, this isn't your Rosa de Guadalupe kind of nolla. These novels explore the relationship between Latin America's physical landscape and its political and cultural landscapes. See, in the 19th century, large swats of Latin America were undeveloped Selva, Yanos, and Compass, jungle, plains, and grassland. And even once fledgling countries like Argentina were free from colonial rule, they didn't have the infrastructure to govern or maintain any sort of orderly democratic control. Enter the Galdos on horseback. These guys were like the most intense gauchos ever. They were more like cowboys and they rode their horses across the bumps, seizing political power through charisma and sheer brute force. They were unfortunately just another type of authoritarian leader. And just like they dominated the Argentinian pampas, Galios also dominated the literature of the period. Domingo Finoto's 1845 novel Fakundo Civic Evvar civilization and barbarism is a prime example. It's a fictionalized biography of the titular Fakundo who's pretty much the platonic ideal of the corrupt Galdo, but he's not 100% fictional. He's based on the lieutenant of real life Argentinian dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas. And just like his right-hand man, Rosas came from a wealthy landowning family and used his power to become a swaggering Galdo. Then he kept forcing his way to the top, eventually becoming dictator of Argentina for 17 years, using tactics like spies and secret police to silence political opposition and exiling guys like Sardento who dared to question his authority. Now the Argentinian pampas are huge about the size of Beyonce's Texas and Sardento describes them lyrically. immense the plains, immense the forests, immense the rivers, the always uncertain horizon. Apparently, everything is bigger in Argentina, too. But Sagmentoto also thinks the region is barbaric because the Pampas are so isolated from so-called civilization. Sadento hoped to convince readers that as long as Argentina existed as an untamed region, the land would continue to produce dangerous strong men like Rosas and Fakundo. He writes from these characteristics arises in the life of the Argentine people, the reign of brute force, the supremacy of the strongest, the absolute and irresponsible authority of rulers. In other words, the Caldo strongman is a direct result of the undeveloped landscape. Quite the theory. Santo called for economic development and improving the country's education system to finally rid the region of tyrants. And he led some of that himself when he was elected president of Argentina in 1868, 16 years after Rossas was overthrown. But he also propped up a false binary of barbarism and civilization. Although the Pampas were isolated and not heavily populated, they weren't empty of people or communities. They were home to indigenous groups like the Mapuche and Pampas Indians of Argentina and the Guani Indians of Paraguay. people who Serento aimed to erase both in his literature and as a president who waged a decadesl long war against indigenous peoples. So although Smento was democratically elected and made meaningful strides for the country, he's still a controversial figure. Now let's travel forward in time to the 20th century, which was, you guessed it, also chalk full of dictators, strong men, and bloody revolutions. Wow, this episode really has no chill. In 1910, Mexico rose up against the 30-year tenure of dictator Porfidio Diaz, resulting in a decadel long revolution that killed over 1 million people. In 1959, Fulhensio Batista, the Cuban military officer turned dictator was overthrown in the Cuban revolution and Chile's 1973 Gulp Pedestat resulted in the death of President Salvadorende and helped establish the military dictator Agusto Pinoce in his place. All of this was topped off with guerrilla warfare, police violence, kidnappings, and disappearances at the hands of the government and a whole general vibe of persecution that was decidedly not it. And from all this bloody violence emerged more novellas delicador written sometime between 1950 and 1975. Many of these novels were part of the boom. The literary movement we talked about in an earlier episode that saw Latin American novels in translation popping off around the world. In fact, many folks consider the boom period to start off with one novella delicado in particular. El seor presidente Mr. President by the Guatemalan writer Miguelanel Atorias. Here are the curly notes. Published in 1946, El Seor Presidente tells the story of a fictionalized dictator who rules over an unnamed country with an iron fist. Known only as the president, he rarely appears in the text and yet he hangs over every character in action like a cloud of tyrant scented freze. The main character is actually the president's favorite adviser, Miguel Angelface, who carries out his boss's dirty work in exchange for safety and power. But when Angelface falls in love with the daughter of an alleged traitor, he starts to question his loyalties. You know how the story goes. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boy gets in trouble with the terrifying dictator. Anyway, the novel also includes elaborate dream sequences, blending realistic elements with magical ones in a technique called magical realism. And this makes it hard for both the characters and the reader to sort out fact from fiction, which mirrors some of the psychological effects of living under a dictatorship. I won't spoil the end of a singor presidente for you, but suffice it to say that Atorias has a message to get across about loyalty and power in the face of tyrants. And while some argue that the president might be modeled on Guatemalan leader Manuel Estrada Cabrera, allegedly allegedly, other scholars say the decision to write about an unnamed dictator in an unnamed country tells us something else. That the novel is less interested in recounting the story of one historical figure and more interested in exploring the effects that a dictatorship has on a society. Those lessons can be applied across Latin America and the rest of the world. Now, let's move forward into the 1990s. Here, we start to see many dictator novels being written after the dictatorships ended, giving modern readers new perspective on tyrants of the past. Like Julia Alvarez's English language novel, In the Time of the Butterflies, takes place in the Dominican Republic during the dictatorship of Raphael Trujillo, the guy we talked about at the top of this episode, but it was published 60 years later in 1994. I wonder what they'll be writing about us 60 years from now. In the time of the butterflies tells the story of ordinary Dominicans, the real life Miraal sisters, Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa. The sisters were part of the underground resistance against Ruhill's brutal regime and they were killed on his orders on November 25th, 1960. Unwittingly, Thruhill turned the Miraal sisters into martyrs for the revolutionary cause. They became known as Lasibosas, the butterflies. Just 6 months later, he was assassinated. Alvarez had a personal interest in the story of the Miraal sisters. Four months before their murder, her own family had escaped to the US when her father was targeted by the Dominican Republic's secret police. But when she turned to the sister's story years later, she felt that their role as martyrs had flattened who they were as people. So, she decided to write about their personal lives through historical fiction. In the novel, each sister, including the sole survivor, Dee, narrates several chapters from her own point of view. We follow them as they grow up, fall in love, and dream about their futures. In other words, as their everyday lives continue, even in the face of a dictatorship, through makes only four brief, menacing appearances, and each of the sisters comes to realize he's not the benevolent figure he claims to be. When Meda finally gets to go to school, where she learns the truth about Thruio, she laments, ""I just left a smaller cage to go into a bigger one, the size of our whole country."" Yearning for freedom is a pretty relatable sentiment for anyone who's ever been a kid. And Minva's discovery that freedom is an impossibility for everyone in her country is a painful reversal. By reading about real ordinary people like the Miraal sisters, we get a richer understanding of life under dictatorship and fiction provides a window into history that's different from textbooks and official documents. Like Alvarez writes in her post script, ""A novel is not after all a historical document, but a way to travel through the human heart. The novela dictador is a distinctly Latin American genre, and there are even more dictator novels than the ones we talked about today. The Underdogs by Mariano Auela, Dona Barbara by Romelo Gosopremo by Austo Roavastos, and The Farming of Bones by Eduge Tantika to name just a few. And these novels prove that fiction can give us a lot more perspective and nuance than the tyrannical voice of a dictator, which is a big deal because unfortunately, dictatorships aren't a phenomenon of the past. Today over 50 countries in the world are living under authoritarian regimes. Tyrants like want their victims to buy into a single story. But when we step into the hearts and minds of others through fiction, we learn to see the world and ourselves more complexely. Next time we'll talk about the role of memory in the aftermath of dictatorships. See you then.

and this is crash course latin american literature.  music  the countries of latin america are no strangers to authoritarianism. the kind of government that requires unquestioning loyalty and offers little individual freedom in return. strong men, tyrants, and dictators have marked the region's history and literature for hundreds of years. so much so that a whole genre distinct to latin american literature emerged around it. la nolla del dictador the dictator novel. these books offer something different from an officially sanctioned singular story. they give us multiple perspectives, critiques, and glimpses behind the scenes into people's everyday lives. let's start in the 19th century. a lot of latin america's trouble with tyrants stemmed from something unexpected. geography. seriously, this is such a big deal that there's a whole genre called nollas de laier, novels of the earth. and no, this isn't your rosa de guadalupe kind of nolla. these novels explore the relationship between latin america's physical landscape and its political and cultural landscapes. see, in the 19th century, large swats of latin america were undeveloped selva, yanos, and compass, jungle, plains, and grassland. and even once fledgling countries like argentina were free from colonial rule, they didn't have the infrastructure to govern or maintain any sort of orderly democratic control. enter the galdos on horseback. these guys were like the most intense gauchos ever. they were more like cowboys and they rode their horses across the bumps, seizing political power through charisma and sheer brute force. they were unfortunately just another type of authoritarian leader. and just like they dominated the argentinian pampas, galios also dominated the literature of the period. domingo finoto's 1845 novel fakundo civic evvar civilization and barbarism is a prime example. it's a fictionalized biography of the titular fakundo who's pretty much the platonic ideal of the corrupt galdo, but he's not 100  fictional. he's based on the lieutenant of real life argentinian dictator juan manuel de rosas. and just like his right-hand man, rosas came from a wealthy landowning family and used his power to become a swaggering galdo. then he kept forcing his way to the top, eventually becoming dictator of argentina for 17 years, using tactics like spies and secret police to silence political opposition and exiling guys like sardento who dared to question his authority. now the argentinian pampas are huge about the size of beyonce's texas and sardento describes them lyrically. immense the plains, immense the forests, immense the rivers, the always uncertain horizon. apparently, everything is bigger in argentina, too. but sagmentoto also thinks the region is barbaric because the pampas are so isolated from so-called civilization. sadento hoped to convince readers that as long as argentina existed as an untamed region, the land would continue to produce dangerous strong men like rosas and fakundo. he writes from these characteristics arises in the life of the argentine people, the reign of brute force, the supremacy of the strongest, the absolute and irresponsible authority of rulers. in other words, the caldo strongman is a direct result of the undeveloped landscape. quite the theory. santo called for economic development and improving the country's education system to finally rid the region of tyrants. and he led some of that himself when he was elected president of argentina in 1868, 16 years after rossas was overthrown. but he also propped up a false binary of barbarism and civilization. although the pampas were isolated and not heavily populated, they weren't empty of people or communities. they were home to indigenous groups like the mapuche and pampas indians of argentina and the guani indians of paraguay. people who serento aimed to erase both in his literature and as a president who waged a decadesl long war against indigenous peoples. so although smento was democratically elected and made meaningful strides for the country, he's still a controversial figure. now let's travel forward in time to the 20th century, which was, you guessed it, also chalk full of dictators, strong men, and bloody revolutions. wow, this episode really has no chill. in 1910, mexico rose up against the 30-year tenure of dictator porfidio diaz, resulting in a decadel long revolution that killed over 1 million people. in 1959, fulhensio batista, the cuban military officer turned dictator was overthrown in the cuban revolution and chile's 1973 gulp pedestat resulted in the death of president salvadorende and helped establish the military dictator agusto pinoce in his place. all of this was topped off with guerrilla warfare, police violence, kidnappings, and disappearances at the hands of the government and a whole general vibe of persecution that was decidedly not it. and from all this bloody violence emerged more novellas delicador written sometime between 1950 and 1975. many of these novels were part of the boom. the literary movement we talked about in an earlier episode that saw latin american novels in translation popping off around the world. in fact, many folks consider the boom period to start off with one novella delicado in particular. el seor presidente mr. president by the guatemalan writer miguelanel atorias. here are the curly notes. published in 1946, el seor presidente tells the story of a fictionalized dictator who rules over an unnamed country with an iron fist. known only as the president, he rarely appears in the text and yet he hangs over every character in action like a cloud of tyrant scented freze. the main character is actually the president's favorite adviser, miguel angelface, who carries out his boss's dirty work in exchange for safety and power. but when angelface falls in love with the daughter of an alleged traitor, he starts to question his loyalties. you know how the story goes. boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boy gets in trouble with the terrifying dictator. anyway, the novel also includes elaborate dream sequences, blending realistic elements with magical ones in a technique called magical realism. and this makes it hard for both the characters and the reader to sort out fact from fiction, which mirrors some of the psychological effects of living under a dictatorship. i won't spoil the end of a singor presidente for you, but suffice it to say that atorias has a message to get across about loyalty and power in the face of tyrants. and while some argue that the president might be modeled on guatemalan leader manuel estrada cabrera, allegedly allegedly, other scholars say the decision to write about an unnamed dictator in an unnamed country tells us something else. that the novel is less interested in recounting the story of one historical figure and more interested in exploring the effects that a dictatorship has on a society. those lessons can be applied across latin america and the rest of the world. now, let's move forward into the 1990s. here, we start to see many dictator novels being written after the dictatorships ended, giving modern readers new perspective on tyrants of the past. like julia alvarez's english language novel, in the time of the butterflies, takes place in the dominican republic during the dictatorship of raphael trujillo, the guy we talked about at the top of this episode, but it was published 60 years later in 1994. i wonder what they'll be writing about us 60 years from now. in the time of the butterflies tells the story of ordinary dominicans, the real life miraal sisters, patria, minerva, and maria teresa. the sisters were part of the underground resistance against ruhill's brutal regime and they were killed on his orders on november 25th, 1960. unwittingly, thruhill turned the miraal sisters into martyrs for the revolutionary cause. they became known as lasibosas, the butterflies. just 6 months later, he was assassinated. alvarez had a personal interest in the story of the miraal sisters. four months before their murder, her own family had escaped to the us when her father was targeted by the dominican republic's secret police. but when she turned to the sister's story years later, she felt that their role as martyrs had flattened who they were as people. so, she decided to write about their personal lives through historical fiction. in the novel, each sister, including the sole survivor, dee, narrates several chapters from her own point of view. we follow them as they grow up, fall in love, and dream about their futures. in other words, as their everyday lives continue, even in the face of a dictatorship, through makes only four brief, menacing appearances, and each of the sisters comes to realize he's not the benevolent figure he claims to be. when meda finally gets to go to school, where she learns the truth about thruio, she laments, ""i just left a smaller cage to go into a bigger one, the size of our whole country."" yearning for freedom is a pretty relatable sentiment for anyone who's ever been a kid. and minva's discovery that freedom is an impossibility for everyone in her country is a painful reversal. by reading about real ordinary people like the miraal sisters, we get a richer understanding of life under dictatorship and fiction provides a window into history that's different from textbooks and official documents. like alvarez writes in her post script, ""a novel is not after all a historical document, but a way to travel through the human heart. the novela dictador is a distinctly latin american genre, and there are even more dictator novels than the ones we talked about today. the underdogs by mariano auela, dona barbara by romelo gosopremo by austo roavastos, and the farming of bones by eduge tantika to name just a few. and these novels prove that fiction can give us a lot more perspective and nuance than the tyrannical voice of a dictator, which is a big deal because unfortunately, dictatorships aren't a phenomenon of the past. today over 50 countries in the world are living under authoritarian regimes. tyrants like want their victims to buy into a single story. but when we step into the hearts and minds of others through fiction, we learn to see the world and ourselves more complexely. next time we'll talk about the role of memory in the aftermath of dictatorships. see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course latin american literature, which was filmed

About This Series:
AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on copyright infringement, misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

P.S. Wondering if we used AI to create this series? Nope! Every Complexly video is lovingly, painstakingly human-made.

In the 1960s, most computers were the size of a refrigerator, and they took a long time to do pretty much anything. But by the 2010s, hundreds of millions of people were walking around with personal computers right in their pockets and near infinite information available at the swipe of a fingertip. The change was unbelievably fast. It was like nothing history had ever seen. And yet, it's possible that it won't even hold a candle to what's happening now. Artificial intelligence. Hi, I'm Kushian Avdar and this is Crash Course Futures of AI. [Music] Back in the 60s, that exponential growth in computing power seemed virtually impossible to most people. But one guy saw it coming, an engineer named Gordon Moore. In 1965, he predicted that every 2 years, we'd find a way to get twice as many transistors onto a computer chip as the previous one, making future computers capable of things Moore and his colleagues couldn't even imagine. And he turned out to be totally right. And his prediction came to be known as Moore's law. And it held true for just about 50 years. Today, progress has shifted from transistors and chips to the new frontier of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence or AI is really just a type of computer system, only it's a really advanced computer system that tries to emulate intelligent behavior. AI is kind of an umbrella term that includes some pretty far out there stuff that doesn't even exist yet, but also much more basic programs like the facial recognition software that unlocks your smartphone as long as you don't grow out your beard or shave your head or ditch your glasses thanks to the wonders of LASIK. Ask me how I know. AI is sometimes defined by its ability to do stuff kind of like what humans can do, like learning from errors or making predictions based on prior knowledge or drawing hands. But it can also do stuff humans can't, like remembering every single thing it's ever heard, processing millions of points of data in seconds, and making hyperrealistic fake videos of Tom Cruz covering Dave Matthews Band. But this capability is a pretty new thing, and it's taken decades to get to this point. Back in the 1950s, computers couldn't even help you with your homework or play a game of chess. At least not until 1957. That is the year IBM created the Bernstein chess program. The Bernstein chess program was an example of narrow AI. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that only does one thing. In this case, play a very good game of chess. Basically, it used algorithms that mimicked human strategies, evaluating the board, picking out plausible moves, and simulating them to figure out which one would work the best. Eventually, it got good enough to beat an inexperienced human opponent. But, it would have to be a pretty patient human opponent. The thing took like 8 minutes to make a single move. Although, when I used to play chess with my dad, sometimes we'd take like 20 minutes to make a single move. And that makes the Bernstein chess program seem like a certifiable speed racer. We were thinking like really hard. In the decades to come though, computers got faster and the chess bots got better and better, but they were still no match for good human players. In the 70s, a Russian program named Kaisa became the world champion of computer chess engines, but it still lost to human chess master David Levy. In the 80s, Grandmaster Gary Kasparov, the highest ranked chess player in the world, played against 32 bots at once and beat them all. Then came the '9s and Deep Blue. Building on their success with their earlier chess bot, IBM created Deep Blue. It could evaluate 200 million chess positions per second. And at that rate, Deep Blue could burn through all those different simulations to pick the best possible one. And in 1997, Deep Blue beat Kasparov in a six-game match. It was the first time a machine had beaten a human chess world champion. But Deep Blue, like all those other early chess bots, was still an example of symbolic AI. It's a kind of AI that relies on the logic coded directly into its hardware and makes moves by hard-coded search and evaluation. Meaning, it was never actually learning or improving. It was just following the same human instructions it was programmed with. And while that can be good, it wasn't great. But what if there was a system that operated a little less like an instruction manual and a little more like a human brain? In 2020, a chessbot called Stockfish got something new, an efficiently updatable neural network or NNU, and it totally changed the game. Well, the game was still chess, but you know what I mean. Neural networks are a special kind of computer architecture that works kind of like the human brain, processing information with layers of connected nodes that pass information between them along weighted connection pathways. Unlike symbolic AI, bots that run on any type of neural networks can change based on experience. Like if during practice a chess move leads to a checkmate in three, that pathway will stay and the AI will probably repeat that pattern in the future. But if it costs the network its queen, that AI is probably going to revise its strategy. That process is called deep learning, and it depends on three things. One, the amount of data or information available for AIs to learn from. two, an algorithm to instruct its learning process. And three, what your friend who's like really into AI calls compute, which includes processing power, memory, and storage. And because Stockfish is an efficiently updatable neural network, it's got even more space for that deep learning than a regular neural network. While other AIs would have to re-evaluate the whole chess board every single move, Stockfish can update incrementally, keeping up with every move it plays. And that frees up a lot of processing space, and it lets Stockfish think even harder about its next move, which turns out to be really helpful. Since 2020, it's won basically every computer chess championship there is. Although, it hasn't played me yet. And not to brag, but I have an account on uh chess.com. Since the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, neural networks have been the foundation for basically all our AI up until right now as I'm filming this episode. And that includes the rise of generalpurpose AI. Unlike narrow AI, these systems can take on lots of different tasks to achieve lots of different goals, like writing books, generating images, summarizing articles, recognizing faces, driving cars, and making Will Smith eat spaghetti. General purpose AI isn't only able to engage in deep learning. It's able to do so really, really fast. That's thanks to a tool called a transformer, which lets certain kinds of AI process entire sequences of data at once rather than reading word by word or number by number. That means generalpurpose AI is getting really good at this stuff really quickly. So quickly that some people are starting to wonder how can we keep up. Enter AI benchmarks and scaling laws. In AI, benchmarks are standardized tests that let us measure how well different AI models perform. For narrow AI systems, benchmarks can be pretty straightforward. Like chess engines have a lot of the same benchmarks as human chess players, getting certain feed ratings or beating other players or engines. But for more generalized AI, benchmarks have to evaluate performance across lots of different domains. Like large language models, which are neural networks that use transformers to process language, are supposed to be able to do lots of different things. So, they might be tested on whether they can answer academic questions and accurately summarize things they've read and write a 10-minute romantic comedy in the style of When Harry Met Sally. AI agents like self-driving cars might have to prove they can drive safely in the rain and not hit a pedestrian on the street. When AI models can consistently perform well on a benchmark, it's considered saturated. But these days, benchmark saturation is happening kind of freaky fast. In a world where AI can identify faces, compose music, drive cars, and take PhD level exams, the question is less what can AI do and more what can't it do? And it's something we want to figure out before we're staring down the barrel of the AI apocalypse. The question is how? Thankfully, the things we already know about AI, like past benchmarks, can help with that. If you look at how different AI systems perform on different benchmarks, you can see certain patterns and one leaps out right away. In general, AI neural networks that are fed more data perform better. The more books a large language model reads, the better it'll be at writing its own. The more videos of Tom Cruz a video generator watches, the more lifelike its fake Tom Cruz will look. He's beautiful. Particularly if that's paired with more compute and other scaling increases. If we squint, we can actually put some numbers on those patterns and come up with formulas that describe exactly how an AI's performance seems to change with different amounts of data, compute, or both. We call those formulas scaling laws. And so far, they help us predict what future AI with even more data, even more compute might be able to do. Full disclosure, the formulas themselves kind of look like nonsense for everyone, but the most saturated AI nerd, but they all mean the same thing. Bigger is better. In the world of neural networks and deep learning, being able to find patterns and learn from huge quantities of data is going to work better than waiting for a human expert to code them in. And the more compute these machines have, the faster and the more powerful they'll be. Now, of course, there are caveats. China's DeepSk is able to compete with models like chat GPT despite having a fraction of the compute. Plus, throwing all that compute at pre-training isn't showing the returns it once was. But still, scaling laws explain why some of the highest performing generalized AI models belong to huge companies like Microsoft and Google since they've got access to tons of data and tons of processing power. And following that pattern into the future, scaling laws can help us predict how capable AI might become, gaining the power to transform our economy or hand us over to authoritarian dictators or make all our likenesses sing covers of the Dave Matthews Band. Crash course into me. Yeah, baby. I'm old. Woo! Are you feeling those singles of excitement yet? Imagine how AI feels. Just kidding. It It can't feel probably. Just like Moore's law foretold unimaginably small and fast computers, scaling laws see a big future for AI. As algorithms improve and data and compute keep increasing, AI could deep learn its way to some pretty advanced stuff like finding new treatments for cancer or achieving super intelligence. Moore's law held up for a good 50 years, bringing us into this new era of computing before slowing down. And there's no guarantee that scaling laws will last even that long, thanks to potential bottlenecks down the road. But any day now, AI could turn some new corner and scaling laws might not be enough to tell if it's still harmlessly marching pawns around or coming for us all. Next time, we'll look closer at what AI could really do in our society other than lock us out of our phones if and when emo bangs come back in style.

in 2020, a chessbot called stockfish got something new, an efficiently updatable neural network or nnu, and it totally changed the game. well, the game was still chess, but you know what i mean. neural networks are a special kind of computer architecture that works kind of like the human brain, processing information with layers of connected nodes that pass information between them along weighted connection pathways. unlike symbolic ai, bots that run on any type of neural networks can change based on experience. like if during practice a chess move leads to a checkmate in three, that pathway will stay and the ai will probably repeat that pattern in the future. but if it costs the network its queen, that ai is probably going to revise its strategy. that process is called deep learning, and it depends on three things. one, the amount of data or information available for ais to learn from. two, an algorithm to instruct its learning process. and three, what your friend who's like really into ai calls compute, which includes processing power, memory, and storage. and because stockfish is an efficiently updatable neural network, it's got even more space for that deep learning than a regular neural network. while other ais would have to re-evaluate the whole chess board every single move, stockfish can update incrementally, keeping up with every move it plays. and that frees up a lot of processing space, and it lets stockfish think even harder about its next move, which turns out to be really helpful. since 2020, it's won basically every computer chess championship there is. although, it hasn't played me yet. and not to brag, but i have an account on uh chess.com. since the deep learning revolution of the 2010s, neural networks have been the foundation for basically all our ai up until right now as i'm filming this episode. and that includes the rise of generalpurpose ai. unlike narrow ai, these systems can take on lots of different tasks to achieve lots of different goals, like writing books, generating images, summarizing articles, recognizing faces, driving cars, and making will smith eat spaghetti. general purpose ai isn't only able to engage in deep learning. it's able to do so really, really fast. that's thanks to a tool called a transformer, which lets certain kinds of ai process entire sequences of data at once rather than reading word by word or number by number. that means generalpurpose ai is getting really good at this stuff really quickly. so quickly that some people are starting to wonder how can we keep up. enter ai benchmarks and scaling laws. in ai, benchmarks are standardized tests that let us measure how well different ai models perform. for narrow ai systems, benchmarks can be pretty straightforward. like chess engines have a lot of the same benchmarks as human chess players, getting certain feed ratings or beating other players or engines. but for more generalized ai, benchmarks have to evaluate performance across lots of different domains. like large language models, which are neural networks that use transformers to process language, are supposed to be able to do lots of different things. so, they might be tested on whether they can answer academic questions and accurately summarize things they've read and write a 10-minute romantic comedy in the style of when harry met sally. ai agents like self-driving cars might have to prove they can drive safely in the rain and not hit a pedestrian on the street. when ai models can consistently perform well on a benchmark, it's considered saturated. but these days, benchmark saturation is happening kind of freaky fast. in a world where ai can identify faces, compose music, drive cars, and take phd level exams, the question is less what can ai do and more what can't it do? and it's something we want to figure out before we're staring down the barrel of the ai apocalypse. the question is how? thankfully, the things we already know about ai, like past benchmarks, can help with that. if you look at how different ai systems perform on different benchmarks, you can see certain patterns and one leaps out right away. in general, ai neural networks that are fed more data perform better. the more books a large language model reads, the better it'll be at writing its own. the more videos of tom cruz a video generator watches, the more lifelike its fake tom cruz will look. he's beautiful. particularly if that's paired with more compute and other scaling increases. if we squint, we can actually put some numbers on those patterns and come up with formulas that describe exactly how an ai's performance seems to change with different amounts of data, compute, or both. we call those formulas scaling laws. and so far, they help us predict what future ai with even more data, even more compute might be able to do. full disclosure, the formulas themselves kind of look like nonsense for everyone, but the most saturated ai nerd, but they all mean the same thing. bigger is better. in the world of neural networks and deep learning, being able to find patterns and learn from huge quantities of data is going to work better than waiting for a human expert to code them in. and the more compute these machines have, the faster and the more powerful they'll be. now, of course, there are caveats. china's deepsk is able to compete with models like chat gpt despite having a fraction of the compute. plus, throwing all that compute at pre-training isn't showing the returns it once was. but still, scaling laws explain why some of the highest performing generalized ai models belong to huge companies like microsoft and google since they've got access to tons of data and tons of processing power. and following that pattern into the future, scaling laws can help us predict how capable ai might become, gaining the power to transform our economy or hand us over to authoritarian dictators or make all our likenesses sing covers of the dave matthews band. crash course into me. yeah, baby. i'm old. woo! are you feeling those singles of excitement yet? imagine how ai feels. just kidding. it it can't feel probably. just like moore's law foretold unimaginably small and fast computers, scaling laws see a big future for ai. as algorithms improve and data and compute keep increasing, ai could deep learn its way to some pretty advanced stuff like finding new treatments for cancer or achieving super intelligence. moore's law held up for a good 50 years, bringing us into this new era of computing before slowing down. and there's no guarantee that scaling laws will last even that long, thanks to potential bottlenecks down the road. but any day now, ai could turn some new corner and scaling laws might not be enough to tell if it's still harmlessly marching pawns around or coming for us all. next time, we'll look closer at what ai could really do in our society other than lock us out of our phones if and when emo bangs come back in style. crash course futures of ai was produced in partnership with the future of life institute. this episode was filmed at our studio in indianapolis, indiana, and was made with the help of all these nice people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone forever, you can join our community on patreon.",11778,2040
0Y3ekwHfq5g,Crash Course Preview: What Are the Possible Futures of AI?,"Welcome to Crash Course: Futures of AI! Our host Kousha Navidar is here to guide you through the ins and outs of our potential AI futures. 

AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on copyright infringement, misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

P.S. Wondering if we used AI to create this series? Nope! Every Complexly video is lovingly, painstakingly human-made.

Even the best human minds aren't totally sure how it's all going to go down just yet. But we are sure AI has the potential to make our society more advanced and also to spread fake news, decimate the job market, exacerbate wealth inequality, and even prop up authoritarian rulers across the globe. And that puts scientists, political leaders, and our whole society in the pretty tricky position of having to react to something that hasn't actually happened yet. But one thing is pretty certain. If we don't start predicting and preparing for the future of AI now, things could look a lot less like Baymax from Big Hero 6 and a lot more like Hal from Space Odyssey.

I'm Kaitlin Hoffmeister. Thank you so much for coming to learnathon. Happy learnathon. And welcome to the crash course writing workshop. This Crash Course workshop is brought to you by executive acting executive producer and editorial director Megan Mafairy and Crash Course script editor Annie Fillinworth. I'm Caitlyn Hoffmeister. I'm the former executive producer of Sihow and now a freelance producer and writer. I also have the pleasure this coming semester of teaching post-production and science writing at the University of Idaho. And behind the scenes today is the amazing mastermind behind all of Learnathon, Laser Weber. Thank you Laser for running everything. Um, in just a minute I'm going to hand the reins of this conversation over to Megan and Annie. But before I do, I want to give you a sense of what to expect. So Megan and Annie built this workshop based on the frequent questions they get around how a crash course is researched, written, and edited. And so they're going to walk us through each of those different steps involved in that. And if you have questions throughout, please add them in the chat and I will ask Megan and Annie on the side or Laser will throw them up so they can ask answer those questions in real time as we go through or potentially we'll save them for the end if that's a better time for some of them. Um, and now all three of us on this chat are on this call are very used to making things for the internet. Um, so of course that means we love love YouTube comments. Um, so in presentations like this it can feel kind of weird because we can't see you. So we would love you to be really active in the chat. If you are excited about something and if we could see you and we could see you like leaning in, wanting to know more about something, we would probably like shift how we're presenting the information. So if you're having a lean-in moment and you want Megan or Annie to slow down and talk more about something, let us know in the chat. If you're confused, like if we could be able to see your furrowed brow and be like, ""Is that making sense?"" Let's explain it another way, go ahead and put like a question mark or say, ""Could you repeat in the in the chat?"" Um, both Laser and I will be watching the chat closely throughout this. Um, and now um and then if you're just excited about something, share that. We would love it. Um, and so as I hand this over to Megan and Annie now to introduce themselves, please if you could introduce yourself in the chat, hopefully you're doing that already a bit. Um, share where you're watching from. Share if you've watched any other Learnathon content this month. Um, and without further ado, let me introduce you to Megan and Annie from the Crash Course team. Awesome. Thank you so much, Kaitlyn. Who are these people? I uh, I'll start. My name is Megan Mafairy. I've been at Crash Course for about 3.5 years. And up here on this slide are a few photos that represent moments on my journey before I came to Crash Course. So, um, going from right to left, uh, because that's an ordinary direction to go in. Uh, at in the right you'll see a picture of me at Georgetown. That's where I got my master's degree. Uh, I studied English with a focus on the environmental humanities. Basically, what I focused on was how we tell stories that help us make sense of climate change and how climate change sort of complicates the way that we used to tell stories and the way that we should tell stories about the future. Uh, and when I was in grad school, I was able to make a podcast instead of a thesis. And then later, I got to interview with Hank and talk about my podcast as part of getting this job. So that's a story I always love to tell when I give when I talk to folks who are like trying to move into a different part of their career. I say just like do your best to make the kind of things that you want to be making. And that was a really really big moment for me um where it it panned out and I was I was so pleased. Um, so before that I was at National Geographic, um, and I was working on educational programs for teachers who were interested in, um, including more environmental and cultural literacy in all different types of subjects they taught. And uh the leftmost photo represents a moment uh right at the very beginning, very early in my career when I was working as a public radio producer uh for a little show in North Carolina. It was a daily live talk show. And a big part of my job was to research the topic of conversation before uh before the show happened live and to brief the host about what what everything was going to be about. Um, and in this particular conversation, we were talking about a new exhibit at our local science museum that was focused on um, spittlebugs. This bug that you see here in the picture, uh, they like surround themselves with this spit-like casing. And I was just telling the host all about the different scientific reasons behind this. And uh there was this like really this moment I always remember where um my boss interrupted me and she goes, ""Wow, you love science."" And I was like, ""What? I don't No, I don't. I I had never thought about myself as a person who loved science. You know, from a young age, I felt like I was sort of an English social studies type person."" And uh I it was a moment and but she was like, ""No, listen to the enthusiasm in your voice. You love science."" And it was just a moment that really opened my eyes and made me think about how much further science can resonate when it's focused on stories and the excitement of discovery. And that was a big influential moment that I I think about all the time now doing what we do here at Crash Course. Uh, and now I'll let Annie tell some stories about her journey. Yeah. So, hi, I'm Annie Fillenworth. Um, I've been at Complexity for three years. Three amazing years. Really made so many great things in that time. Um, and yeah, my background is in creative writing. Um, I studied creative writing in undergrad at Fairley Dickson University in New Jersey. I'm based in Philly now. Yes, that is City Hall the night the Eagles won the Super Bowl. Go birds. Um, and then I earned my masters at the New School in New York City. Those are some of our illustrious alums of the writing for children and young adult program like Jenny Han and Danielle Clayton. Um, had a really amazing experience there. And then, um, I graduated into the pandemic. Um, which is, you know, no one's ideal scenario. Um, but I spent that time also like making things that I wanted to see. So, I um started a podcast with my friend Jill where we talked about um movies and TV shows for kids from the 2000s. I published some of my own work and I got my first big girl job as an editor at a small puzzle books company uh in suburban the suburban Philadelphia area. Um and then I started working at Crash Course. So, I got to sort of use a lot of my different skills and niche interests um in this job and I've worked on a bunch of shows um under the illustrious guidance of Megan. Awesome. Thank you both. Um so, yeah, if you I'm going to ask I'm going to ask a question for the chat first, but then I would love it if you both could tell us how a crash course script gets made. And for all of you watching at home, thank you for telling me where you're from. Massachusetts girly. Go birds. Um, how many people do you think the average crash course script goes through before production? We tend to talk about steps and there's pre-production, production, when it's filmed, and post-production. So, but within each of those steps, there's a lot going on. So, if you have any guesses about how many people you think the average Crash Grow script touches before it goes to be filmed with the host, go ahead and make your guesses in the chat and Megan and Annie will teach us that along the way. Awesome. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about what makes a crash course script. Um, you know, what exactly is the special sauce of of a crash course script? And, um, the first thing is that it needs to be accurate. Um, anytime you're making educational materials or tools, that's the bottom line is that we have to be as accurate as possible. So, the crash course scripts go through lots of people to make sure that our scripts are as accurate as possible. We use um primary sources and peer-reviewed research. We have fact checkers, experts in the field. Um, and we also share our sources for each of the videos in the description to make sure we're as transparent as possible. Um, so that's like the main thing, but then also you might know that like we have a crown coursey tone and um that comes from trying to be clear, engaging, and inclusive. So we try to make our videos as accessible as possible and not use too much jargon, you know, define terms when we have them. Um, but make sure it's like simple language that feels everyday and conversational and that is engaging in the way a conversation with a friend would be. We like to learn alongside the viewer rather than simply teach. Um, and our videos also answer the so what. So, we talk about a lot in editorial spaces, which is we're learning something, but why does it matter? Why should the viewer care that u we're learning this information? And that really guides and propels both the series and each individual script. Um, and we also build around narrative. Um, storytelling is really essential to Crash Course and it helps us remember the things we learn and put them into context with our daily lives. So, we'll talk much more about narrative in a second, but um, our next um, quality is that all our scripts are entirely original. We do not use AI in any of our creative work. Um, and we make sure everything is crystal clear, not plagiarized. Um any script you hear recited by the host has been um made by humans which we really pride ourselves in. Um and our scripts also treat our audience with honesty, nuance and care. We want to really imagine that our audience are the complex people that they are and try to showcase stories um and also like hypothetical scenarios that feel like they represent a wide variety of people. And so how does this all start? Um once we have a series green lit, the first step is to sort of envision what the series might look like. And so that starts with a brainstormed episode list. We often enlist the help of a subject matter expert who can help us figure out what do we want all the episodes to be about? Um how do we want to convey the information? What are some possible hooks and stories that we could use to express that information? And so this takes a bit of iteration trying to figure out, you know, how many episodes makes the most sense, what do we want to talk about in each one and sort of a lot of brainstorming happens at this stage. And after that, we create a syllabus. So if you've ever taken a college class, you know, the first day of class, your professor shows up and hands you a piece of paper that details what the whole course is going to cover. And that's what we use as sort of an internal guide for um our for our our videos um and to help our writers uh script their uh videos. So the syllabus is basically a really fleshed out episode list. We have things like the course description, the learning objectives, and then we break down each script um topic into subtopics and put in all of the actual concrete information that we want to convey. So, we'll have things like key terms, but also fun stuff like special segments or also misconceptions we want to make sure that we address or don't fall into. Um, and then that is sort of the framework that the writer uses to create their first draft. And so that takes a lot of research on their part, looking through all of the uh sources that are linked in the syllabus and figuring out how to build a story around that information. And so after that it goes through many rounds of edits including through me through Megan and eventually after going through a fact checker and a producer and the host it becomes a real actual video. Um shout out to Latin American literature which is airing now. Okay so here's the answer to the question. A it does range, but somewhere around 8 to 10 plus people work on every crash course script. And that's just the script. You should more than double it once you start to get into the video elements and the animation elements. Sometimes we have uh you know illustrator like for Native American history, we have illustrators who are from indigenous cultures and things like that. And then that um that adds more and more collaborators which is is something that uh is so fun and and rewarding for us and we hope it is for the audience as well. Um so I'm going to show you I know you can't see this. Uh and I kind of wanted to show it to you this way just to emphasize like it doesn't fit on a slide. The crash course script process is so elaborate it doesn't really fit on a slide. But I am going to sort of um zoom in for you and show you a a high level of our full sort of flowchart of how a crash course script gets made. Um so I'm going to try to zoom in. Um basically we start once yeah like Annie said once we decide to make a series the first thing we do is we hire a subject matter expert. That's going to take a few months. Then we move into a sort of curriculum development phase. So, we're taking several weeks to develop an episode list, like a highlevel outline, like she talked about. Then, we're taking several more weeks to fill out that outline with sources, with story ideas, etc. If we have a funding partner, of course, there's back and forth during that part. Um, finally, once the syllabus is complete, we move into scripting. And I don't expect you I'm just sort of taking you through this just to give you a sense of the scope. Obviously, there's not going to be a pop quiz at the end. Um but yeah, then we move into a first draft. We have our subject matter expert review every single draft to make sure that we've gotten everything right at a high level. We have uh multiple edits. So first we have like a developmental edit which is more focused on story and priorities. You know, did we spend enough time on one thing and too much time on another thing? Things like that. Then we have the the lead editor do a second edit. Um and then uh things get passed to different types of stakeholders. The script gets passed to different types of stakeholders. So, we send the script to our producers and our producers are really focused on like like I always tell this story that one time um in our religion series, we had an introduction that was about uh a small community who experienced what felt to this community at this church like to be a miracle. And it was that there was a painting on their church and it it like started dripping oil and they were like, ""This is a miracle, a modern miracle."" Um, and I was like, ""Oh, this is such an exciting place to start the script."" And the producer was like, ""Okay, but what are they going to see on screen? It's lit. It's a wall. You want you want people to look at a wall, just a blank a wall. It it's it's as it's almost paint drying. That's what you're asking for."" So, the producers bring a really different perspective than what we might be thinking about on the editorial side, and that's really helpful. We also have our host review the scripts and change up little jokes and references to make it more personal to them. And then fact check, copy edit. So that's when we go back through to make sure um you know just polish everything, make sure we're not being too redundant, make sure everything feels sensitive. And then finally we get to the table read which is a sort of a rehearsal with our host. But I will move off of this annoying and difficult to look at Figma board. um and move back to our deck if I can. Let's see. Cool. And I feel like now is a great time while you while you do that, Megan, looking at all those people on all those stages. Um I just want to thank Crash Course is free. Uh Crash Course is free for everyone and is meant to be accessible. And so I want to thank Shannon Alexander and Tia Hazard for donating. This part of the reason we're doing this for Learnathon is to make sure that Crash Course will always be free. So, thank you all for being here and thank you for for supporting what what these guys do. Um, cool. And so, oh, can you still hear me? I just lost one headphone. Um, so moving forward, Annie, you had mentioned that we're going to talk more about narrative. Um, and so let's go ahead and talk that. How do you take this commitment to accuracy, all this research that you're doing, and then turn it into a compelling story that people are going to not only be interested in watching, but also that will help stay in their minds? And um I just before I actually pass it over to you, uh some questions that came up that are related to that is do you follow like a certain kind of style guide um and how does that interact with with that process? Yeah, we have our own style guide that we sort of adhere to, but it's also sort of in flux. We don't necessarily we're not strictly AP or Chicago or anything like that. Also, because the information is imparted verbally, so you can't really see the text anyway, but we do have a style guide that helps us keep things in order um on our end. Awesome. Uh so yeah, big big picture we something we really think about when we're trying to figure out how to make it all a story. Uh we ask ourselves the these three questions. What am I learning that I didn't know before? What's making me feel something? And what's my genuine journey of discovery? Um almost all of the time our writers are not experts on the subject. And so when we give them this these syllabi, they are genuinely reading information, digesting things, synthesizing information for the first time, learning a lot of things for the first time. And that means that we get frustrated sometimes. We get confused. We're grasping for like analogies and metaphors to try to latch on to something we already know. And then sometimes those fall apart and we have to start again. that whole process of learning um it happens to us and every time we try to write a crash course script and you know when you grow up when you go to school you learn to hide that whole part of the writing process and just document okay I've sorted it out and let me put the clean and finished part on the page but what we try to do is really hold on to what were the highs and lows of my journey to understanding this information what were the twists and turns the moments where I fell into a misconception or got confused and how did I sort of resolve that and we try to build a story from that. Um, and I I think this is like an extremely nerdy thing to say, but I I think I can prove it to you. um that it it seems crazy to say that we would we take our journey of discovery and make it like a plot, but um I'm going to show you how we you can really layer a crash course script onto this is like a common plot structure. I pulled this from the legendary comedy training center upright Citizens Brigade. This is their um this is like an adapted version of their plot structure for like a TV show pilot, like a comedy TV show pilot. But I'm going to show you how um a crash course script defining and the nerdy concept of what is a species actually kind of fits into this TV pilot format. Um so we'll start with fun. Open with something fun, interesting, and relatable. So this is an example from a real crash course script. A sleepy bassad hound and a tireless border collie look and act like they're from different planets, but they can have a weird looking litter of puppies that can make more puppies. That's because they're the same species. But meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. But sadly, that source can't have more Zorse babies because horses and zebras are different species. So okay, organis two organisms are considered members of the same species if they can mate and make fertile offspring. Okay, but we encounter a frustration right off the bat. Life has been known to break these rules. Like there are some hybrids that can reproduce. You might know some of them without knowing you know them. Like if you've ever had a plumcot from the grocery store, but there are also hybrid animals that can reproduce, including this hybrid lizard species. Uh, and females actually don't even need a mate to do so. So, that completely breaks the definition of species that I just gave to you. We've hit a snag. We've hit our first conflict in our plot. Okay. Well, then the next the next part of the story structure is having a a new plan, a false victory. Okay. So, because of exceptions like the plumcot and that lizard, uh, other scientists think it's better to define species by their genealogy. According to this idea, all organisms in the same evolutionary lineage are one species. Oops. But that gets complicated for a bunch of reasons, including that there are literally billions of extinct species that are pretty tough to learn about and to link with living ones. So, this concept really isn't perfect either. And we really things escalate. We fall into chaos with our plot when we also consider, okay, here's another way to think about species. Uh what if we parse them based on environmental conditions like how polar bears live in a different type of habitat than grizzly bears? Well, that starts to fall apart as soon as you consider any number of species that live in more than one environment. And at this point, we might want to level with our audience. We say, if all of this feels confusing to you, you're actually on to something. In real life, it's really difficult to pin down what makes a species. And every single definition of species that scientists have come up with is imperfect. But we still have to resolve it somehow. Uh and ultimately we land on well humans make knowledge by categorizing things even if those categories aren't as rockolid as we wish they were. Um so our systems for naming and classifying things are totally imperfect and at the same time super super useful. Having working death species definitions lets us compare and contrast things notice what they have in common. But it's also really really interesting when those things break and that helps us learn more about the world and about how nature works. Awesome. Thanks Megan. Um and if any questions come up feel free to drop them in the chat. Um, and yes, that we had talked earlier about the different steps and writing, research and writing, and now we're getting to editing some of the invisible work that goes into this. Um, and then we had a question from earlier. I just want to highlight um that came up from Tass. Thank you, Tass, for asking this. And as you're telling us more about editing, Annie, if you want to tell us, does Crash Course have a plagiarism check used to make sure that someone's not accidentally plagiarizing or maybe one of your writers is is plagiarizing? And what is your process for dealing with potential potential plagiarism and the editing process? Yeah, that's a great question. Um, towards the end of the editing process, we run through all of our scripts uh through Grammarly. They have a great plagiarism check function um that checks it alongside many many many pages and documents on the internet. Um and fortunately we have like a lot of people with good integrity on our team. So I don't know if we've ever come across anything that's been remotely close. Sometimes it might be like this sentence is really close to this sentence and then it's like a quote. Um, so sometimes you might need to like reward a sentence if it just came too close to an original source, but the vast majority of the time there are no problems. Um, especially because of how many edits we go through, it's just so far from the source by then that plagiarism isn't really a concern. But, uh, if there ever were a concern, we would probably address it pretty swiftly. Um, but fortunately, I haven't run into that problem. Um, but yeah, we can get started talking about editing. So, something we thought might be a good idea to talk about today is specifically editing a crash course intro. Um, intros are super important. The first 30 seconds are essential to a video. If you're uh you've ever uploaded anything to YouTube, you know about how long it takes for a view to count. And then also it's what helps us get the attention right away, get it engaged, and then move through and set up the rest of the video. Um, so yeah, the first 30 seconds are super important. And we're going to um talk about some of the common pitfalls that we see when we are editing um crash courseware scripts. So, the first common issue is when an intro meanders. Um, so you can pull up that intro, Megan. Um, so this is an original intro for a script for Crash Course Sexed. And the first thing you might notice is that it's pretty long for 30 seconds. It's kind of a lot of information. Um, and it's covering a lot of great stuff in context, but that's not usually what the function of the intro is. We're more trying to grab attention. an intriguing concept or question. And so a lot of this information is stuff that would better suit later on in the script. Um, even the fun joke we have at the end about how to pronounce LGBTQIA, it's not quite going to hit in an intro. So we decided to take things in a different direction for our edited version. And so where we came to was talking about our host Sham's first crush. So, first crushes are a pretty common experience and we're able to relate to the audience and have them reflect on their own experiences by starting there. And also, it's kind of juicy. Like, it's a little bit gossipy. It's got that fun big sister feel that we were really shooting for with our host for Sex Ed. Um, and so we just sort of connected some barebones ideas and then allowed Shan to come in and add her personal experiences. And that really lightened the tone. it kind of brought us into a very complex idea which is what is sexuality um by talking about something really relatable and easy to understand and um added some punchy questions to get us into the rest of the script. So the next common issue is burying the lead. So obviously when we're we have an intro we want to start with a punch and this story is super interesting from Native American history. We're talking about a tribe that was arguably very successful and then something happened. They got terminated by the federal government and things really went downhill very quickly for them. Um, so it's a really interesting story, but honestly the most interesting part is the sentence right before Chang's introduction where he says uh at the dawning of the termination era that's exactly what makes them a target. So we thought why don't we move some things around to try to make this um more interesting. So in our final version, we started with that idea, shifted it to the top and said things were looking up for the Monomony tribe of Wisconsin and that's exactly what made them a target. So immediately we feel a little bit more suspense, a little bit more intrigue just by moving one sentence and then we keep that same context, but now we have a reason to be interested and then just kind of put a bow on it at the end by saying, you know, the Monomony had a safety net, but it was about to break. So, we're able to really build suspense in um the intro just by shifting a few parts around. Um and our Oh, go ahead, Kayla. Um awesome. Just Nope, you keep going. I will I'll add this one next. I thought I thought there was natural pause. You keep going. Sorry. Right. No worries. Um and uh our last common issue that we'll talk about today is when there isn't enough feeling. So, intros, part of what makes them grabby is um connecting to human emotion. And so this is from an episode of Crash Course Religions about cults. And it's fun. It's got a great light-hearted tone, a sort of, you know, relatable concept of what do we think of when we think of the word cults. Um, but it's a little bit generic and it could probably pack a little bit more of a punch. So, we decided to shake things up a little bit in our edited version where we sort of put the viewer themselves into a scenario. We said, ""Picture this. You're in a cozy room surrounded by people welcoming you with good food and kindness. They're showing interest in your questions, your anxieties, and you hold on a second. Is this a cult? So, it sort of, you know, lulls the viewer into a sense of safety and comfort and then disrupts that immediately that sort of counterintuition is something we often use in our episodes. Um, and also it tackles that kind of relatable question that a lot of people ask themselves, which is like, would I fall for a cult? It's kind of a an intriguing juicy question. Um, and then we tacked on a bit of a punchier end to that as well by saying, can we really tell the difference between a religion and a cult? So, we sort of tightened things up and made them a little bit more packing a punch. Um, and just heightened it. You know, the original intro was fine and great, but we were able to make it even better. And so, you know, these are just intros, but we apply a lot of these same tactics to the rest of the script as well to make things engaging by adding hypothetical scenarios and jokes and personal reflections from the host. All these things can kind of tie together the whole episode. Um, but the intro is where that sort of shines right at the start. Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And then a question that came up um that was sort of timely when talking about sexed is from Rachel and Rachel's question is did theme um but I think this was actually about the host because sometimes the subject matter expert and the host are different people. Um but did the host write the intro about their crush or did a writer write it from their perspective? And I feel like that leads in really nicely to this next section about balancing all that information with making it fun and funny. Um, and then just want to add one more question on there because Lucy Lid sort of anticipated this next coming up as well and asked, ""Do you have any advice or resources converting complicated educational materials in a conversational tone?"" I think you'll kind of answer this one naturally, but just wanted to put those out there as you're as you're talking about this next one. Yeah, and I can speak to that. Yeah, that sex ed intro. Um, yeah, so Sham was our host. We had a different subject matter expert. Um, but we did um sort of build a framework. Sometimes we'll we'll write a section of a script where we say something like in brackets, you know, TK, which is the sort of journalist uh shortand for to come. Um, uh, host experiences. So I think what we had in our sort of intervening episode uh uh edit of this um intro was you know my first crush name um and then something etc etc and then uh I think we had sort of added the stuff about being boy obsessed and boy bands because we had also talked to Shan um before we started scripting about her personality and experiences so we could sort of fill in a little bit of the gaps with what we already knew about her and then she was able provide the specifics later. So, the hosts definitely have um a chance to add their sort of flare to the episodes um as they review them before we ship them. Yeah. And I would say I think my best advice for making complicated information easy to understand is really um tr what it was like when you first learned it. And that can be really hard if you know it really well. But if you can put yourself back in in that space of learning something fresh and what surprised you, what subverted your expectations, what confused you, then I think that helps. Um, I think oftentimes when we know something really well, we skip a lot of steps in explaining it because they just seem obvious. And if you can like think back to, you know, sitting in that freshman year classroom where something really hooked you for the first time um and and try to or or if you can't like talk to a person who doesn't know about it, I think is really good advice. We often if in some cases if we do have an expert writer, it's all the more important that we don't have an expert editor. We we always want uh lay someone who's editing the script to be a lay person relative to the script subject matter. Thankfully, that's really easy at Crash Course because we do a crash course on every possible subject and no one can be an expert on every possible subject. But yeah, I would say making sure someone is is genuinely learning it for the first time uh can react to that to your work on it and that helps a lot. Okay, I'm going to click back forward. I had took us back to that um intro when we were talking about that. But this is another big question we get about making things fun and funny. And I'm going to talk a little bit about here about just like how we think about humor here at Crash Course. Um so I'll start with just some like basic principles of humor writing that are true for any type of humor writing. The first is that quantity is the key to quality. the best comedy writers invisibly write dozens and hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, but you only see the best ones. And so sometimes we're really hard on ourselves uh because we're like, man, I wrote five jokes and they're all bad. Um but that's because we're imagining we're not imagining the intense failure rate that real comedians are experiencing and just filtering before it gets to us. Um, related to that, we work hard on our team to make space for there to be a clown mode and an edit mode. And what I mean by that is that we try to create space in clown mode where we don't judge ourselves where we say the bad idea because maybe the bad idea will spark something in someone else that leads to a good idea. And if we never say the bad idea, then we never get to the quantity, which is the key to the quality, right? like you got to clear out all the bad ideas in order to make space for the good ideas. And um yeah, then later there's edit mode where you are identifying, okay, this one joke out of the 50 options is the best one and you're culling. And these are incredibly self- sustaining. You can only be brave enough to and vulnerable enough to have a clown mode if you know that later there will be the edit mode so your bad ideas won't be showcased. you know these are you really need both uh in order to have like a successful humor team. Um and the other thing I would say is take stock of your toolbox. Um there are all kinds of humor tools. Um humor is very very often formulaic. It's based on repeated and predictable techniques that are going to work again and again in new contexts. Um, and so just to give you some examples, I there are different different types of toolboxes that everybody can have based on your unique context. Um, so I'll tell you a little bit about the crash course toolbox for humor. One question we ask ourselves if we feel like something is not funny enough is, can we add some physical action? For us, uh, the cra the expectation of the viewer is that the host is going to be sitting at the desk. They're a talking head. So, anytime we can put them in a new space or interacting with the world in a new way, that's going to surprise people and that adds an element of humor. Um, so in this case, in Native American history, we're talking about busting myths about about Native American people. And um rather than just talking about that as a metaphor, we took it real literally and we have him putting the myths into a bottle and then smashing them with a bat. Um, so fun. Uh, another thing we ask ourselves is would it help to have a character say it? Again, both of these are these are pretty sensitive examples. Um, here's uh this is from the religions series. Uh, and we wanted to think about how can we talk about religious misconceptions which are essentially they're stereotypes about people, sometimes marginalized groups. um how can we talk about those um but not in a way that feels overly preachy or judgmental. And it really helped to add a character. So we had created this character called the devil's advocate. We had him FaceTime John um our host and wear a tracksuit and a headset and just be like the least likable person um so that we could then correct those misconceptions in a more playful way. Another thing uh ties right back to what Annie was talking about with our sexed um intro example earlier, but it's one thing if that if that intro had been focused on um we all have crushes. That's fine. But uh a good comedy principle is like it's better to have don't talk about a scene somewhere in the future or somewhere in the past. Bring bring it to here. Bring it make it more specific and bring it to here. So we're talking about Devon. We're talking about Shan's crush, Devon. Devon is in the room with us and that really helps a lot. Visuals and sound effects. We love Oh, we love a Christopher Columbus with a single tear down his cheek. We love uh hashtag team Jacob. Little little visual or sound effect moments that can punch up a video. Camera angles and video editing techniques. Here you have Chay making a joke about um the the words that he prefers to refer to himself as. He likes the word indigenous. He also likes the words handsome and brave. And we get a little bit of a closeup and a side angle to show that he's being a little cheeky. Um cool. I just uh I want to check on the timing. Caitlyn, are we are we having a lot of questions? Should I? We have um we have about 15 minutes left and we I have a decent list of questions we could go over. Um and but yeah, let's see. Um I think is it is the exercise you want to do about three minutes? Is that right? Yeah, sure. We could do that exercise. Yeah, I think we could do that. Um maybe we can. Yeah, let's walk us. Yeah, go for it. has a an exercise for us that we can do before we get into more questions. Yeah. Yeah. So, one really really easy tip for making a joke a little bit better is putting the funny part last. And you may have heard of the rule of three, uh, which is a really good example of putting the funny part last. So, the rule of three is a type of joke where you create a pattern or expectation and then you immediately break it. So the audience thinks they know what's coming and then you immediately break it. So in this case we have I love Christmas. What's not to love? Presents, family, and the crushing realization that the joy of childhood is gone forever, right? It's it's just like a very simple formula that anyone anyone can come up with and you can you can play with again and again. So I did want to do a little chat challenge. Um I'd love to challenge you to write a joke in three minutes using the rule of three. Um and I'm going to give you a prompt. The prompt is birthday parties. And the way you're going to do this is you're going to just take I will set a timer. Kaitlyn will set a timer for 3 minutes. You're going to make a list of things that pop into your head that go with birthday parties. But and then you're going to have to think of one thing that relates to birthday parties but sparks a really different feeling than the rest. So the format could be like birthday parties are great, normal thing, normal thing, weird thing. And then we'd love to see your answers in the chat. Uh this is clown mode. So we're all brave because one another is brave, right? Uh we're all on a limb together. There is bad ideas are going to are going to get us to good ideas. So I challenge you to be vulnerable with us. Uh and we'll set a timer for three minutes. All right, timer's going. We are in kind of quiet mode. If you have a piece of paper or your computer in front of you, go ahead and start start writing writing down your ideas. Thank you so much for Aunt Crystal for getting us started with that very quickwitted uh example. And I'll bring us back from this quiet mode gently in about a minute in about two and a half minutes. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey, [Music] hey, hey. [Music] All right, I'm going to bring us back. Thank you all so much for dropping these. Megan and Annie, do you want to read a couple that stood out to you and maybe talk about them? These are all I don't feel like there were any duds. You all are so funny. They're all so good. You're so funny. I I'm The first one I I'm gonna see if I can find it. H candles cake and a candycoated realization that you're hurdling toward death. So good. So, I candycoated realization. So good. I love it. I love it. Annie, did you have a favorite? Yeah, I I really liked um Jen Marker's birthday parties are great. Cake, friends, and watching people sing to you while you sit silently. So true. So true. So relatable. I also just want to shout out Ellipsu. It's Ellipsu's 18th birthday tomorrow. So, happy birthday. I'm so glad you're spending part of your birthday week with us. Yes. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. You guys are so brave. Thank you for Thank you for playing with us. It was really really fun to see your jokes. Um I'll just we'll just quickly wrap up and then we'll transition into slidesh into more FAQs. Um we saw this in your joke examples, but other ways to finaness a joke is to think about contrast. Um, so in the I love Christmas joke example, having the presents the be as far as possible away from the joy of childhood being gone forever. If it was like presents, family, and like being a little tired, then that's not that's not as funny because the contrast is too small. I think that I think the person who wrote about candy coded h hurtling toward death intuitively understood that that was a good contrast. Um, another thing is being being more specific. Um, so a specific detail is always funnier than a broad description. That's why I think we've all heard this in different circumstances. It's always funny to just like give a character a random name. Thanks a lot, Robert. Do we know who Robert is? Doesn't matter. It's just funny because sudden it's more specific. Um, so these are just kind of quick quick um joke improvements. And the last thing I would always say is ask your friends. Humor is social. There's nothing harder than sitting with a page by yourself trying to be funny. There's nothing more depressing. Um, but with people, uh, really really helps and that's that's what we do here on the Crash Course team and here with you today. So, thank you so much. Awesome. Awesome. Thank you. Um, so yeah, now we're gonna we have about 10 more minutes, little little less. So, we have time to talk about your questions. Some of you have already put some in the chat, which thank you so much. Um, if you have more, feel free to drop them in. And if you have more jokes, feel free to drop them in. Um, so the first one I wanted to start with is from Finara, and you've talked about this a little bit, but I love the specificity of this question too, and thought you um, we could talk about it a little bit more. So, for influential but problematic figures in a topic, for example, Salvador Dolli in art history, how do you decide what to explain about them and what to admit for time or clarity? or what are some other ways potentially that you bring up that topic like you were talking about with um with some other series? Would Megan or Annie you want to take it? Go for it Annie. Sure. Um yeah and and Megan feel free to add your thoughts too. Um this is something we talk about all of the time um because unfortunately there are a lot of problematic figures that uh we learn about various topics. Um I think part of it has to do with tone. We try not to sort of valorize those people um or overly praise them for their contributions. Sometimes we'll just present it factually. Um and it's really a case- by case basis. Sometimes it feels relevant to say and by the way this person is not great for XYZ reason or you know keep in mind this other thing. Um, and also sometimes it's about really letting them be a footnote and talking about somebody else who um doesn't have as scarred a reputation uh is from a marginalized background or an underrepresented community um because a lot of their contributions tend to not be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. So sometimes there's room to say um this person in science was a eugenicist. So take everything they say with a grain of salt. But this person over here was doing something really interesting with DNA or something like that where we can sort of highlight news stories from people that we don't know about. Um but also sometimes it's even just a footnote in the description like we're aware that this person is iffy because of XYZ reason a resource to learn more about it. So it really depends on the scenario I think. Awesome. And then Finn Brener just asked, ""Does a host ever make changes to the script on set?"" In my experience, I've never had that not happen. Uh but I' which we love our hosts for that. Uh um and but I wondered too if you could talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk more about the um the read through um the table and and that process and how that helps with that. Yeah, we have a lot of structures in place to try to help the host give input a number of times before we're on set because we used to have the host make more changes on set and we're really open to it because that's when a lot of playfulness can come out, but um we've fact checked everything and sometimes things are so so subtle and you lose the word 'the' and suddenly it's not exactly correct anymore. And um so it's hard to like kind of flag those things on the spot. So, uh, a couple of things we do, like Annie alluded to earlier, one thing we do, um, is when we have a new host, we have like an interview with them where we talk about like what are your embarrassing stories? What's your family like? Do you have pets? What's a weird opinion you have about the world? Um, so we try to get, you know, an understanding of what makes them tick. And then we we write some jokes with them and with that in mind. And with then we leave we also leave a lot of uh placeholders for them. Um, like Annie mentioned, um, then they review the scripts in advance. They fill in the placeholders. We encourage them to react to other parts of the script as well. So, we often get new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for um, you know, anecdotes, things like that um, at that stage. And then, yeah, then we do what we call a table read. It's it's a remote table read. We're all around a virtual table, but there's going to be the producer, the script editor, and the host all in a room reading through the scripts. And in those moments, um, we notice when the host, if they stumble repeatedly over a line, then it's probably the line, it's probably not them. Um, so we'll take a moment and we'll revise that line to make it sound more natural for them. Um, also those are moments where sometimes if a joke doesn't quite land in real time, we'll we'll toss the ball around trying to make the joke a little bit funnier. Um, if something or just something feels wrong, um, then we'll make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. Um then yeah, when we get on set, we can never and we would never want to fully um get rid of host changes on set, but we try to have like one word perfect recording and then one recording with improvisations. So that way if later when we're going through uh we notice that there's a factual discrepancy, we have a take with the word perfect version that we can substitute in for that portion. Thank you. Um, cool. And then we had a couple questions about working with fact checker fact checkers and subject matter experts. So, I'm just going to read a couple of them and and we can have a little bit of a conversation about it. So, Syjoy asks, ""Hi, Syd. Hi, Jacqueline. Is there anything you do in the writing process to make it easier for the fact checker, especially if info is from the subject matter expert and not a primary reference?"" what what happens in that situation. And then Sarah J also asked, ""How many subject matter experts do you reach out to when fact-checking and developing the script? Does it vary by topic?"" Yeah, I can jump in. Um, yeah, factchecking is is its own animal. Um, but part of what our scripting process is like is is keeping the sources with the claims as long as possible in the script version. So the way that we sort of structure scripts literally from the first draft that the writer does is that the last punctuation of a sentence, we have a comment in our Google doc where they link the source and the the sort of text from that source where that claim came from. And so those comments are all visible to the fact checker when they go in and do their fact check and they're finding independent sources that back those claims up. So, we're able to sort of give them a place of like this is where this idea came from. Um, the fact checker might be able to say, ""Hey, that source is actually outdated or there's a newer paper that has more accurate information now or that was debunked a while ago."" Um, and so we can sort of keep track of where the claims came from. Um, and yeah, we always have the subject matter expert that we have sort of developed the series with from day one. Um, but we also might bring in other people who have specific areas of expertise. This happened a lot with um, religions and Native American history. So, when there's particular groups or experiences that we want to make sure that um, we're getting right, but the subject matter expert is more of a generalist. So, that kind of um, yeah, very serious series to series. Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And I think this might be our last question, but before we move on, I wanted to shout out Brooke in the chat who also mentioned script supervisors. Thank you, Brooke, for asking about that. And then thank you again to all of for all of you for being here. And thank you to those of you who donated to help make sure Crash Course is always free for everyone. Um, and so this is two questions um that I'm grouping together kind of like I did with the fact checker. is um is about visuals. Katie Hoben early on asked, ""Could you tell us more about how you think about explanation versus animation in your courses? What type of content is best supported by visual assets?"" And then Lucy Lids asked, ""When writing the script, do you include visual descriptions as you go or later?"" Yeah, this is these are really good questions. Um when we think about animation we I mean we have to think about it any anybody would from like a sort of budget perspective. Animation is in and illustration is incredibly resource intensive. We have incredible um animators and illustrators here uh on the crash course team. Shout out to them. Um so we do have to look at a script and think about like what are the parts that are the most difficult to understand without a really clear visual. And usually that is either that they're very technical um so we're thinking like the parts of the cell or something like that where you you know you can't keep track of there's what 30 different organels you can't you just can't put that in your head um or very very abstract um so if we're thinking about like uh you know like uh the origin stories of Hinduism or something like that um that are we don't ne that the average viewer might not necessarily necessarily have um anything to bring up in their imagination when we come up with it. Then we need to put something on screen to mix up make it a little bit more concrete. Or with our political theory series, when we talk about like liberalism or another philosophical concept, we have to kind of take something abstract and make it concrete often with a metaphor or a character or sometimes just like a graphic organizer like a ven diagram or a chart or something like that. That helps us keep track of we're comparing different concepts. We're thinking of this concept falls within this broader concept and helps the viewers make a mental map. The other thing we think about is the availability of B-roll. Um, and oh, I think I think I have to stop talking because we're going to have a nice live stream. But if there's real life, uh, if we can license photographic or video, um, graphics instead of animation, then that helps a lot. And that it does tend to come after the initial script. um just because there's so much content to get through in the initial script that we have a later pass where we're we're thinking more about visuals and it does end up adding some real significant revisions to the script. I just wanted to shout out that we have a whole uh stream coming up about animation and editing in Crash Course. So, if you're curious about how that stuff happens, uh you should uh join us on Wednesday. Thank you, Laser Megan. Yeah. So, you don't I just want to flag we are at the half hour when we were scheduled to end. Um, so if you were planning your day around this and you have to be in a meeting, thank you so much for coming. Um, and then any uh Megan, did you get to answer completely? Did you feel? Yes. Yes. I thought that that Thank you for sharing that laser. I thought that it was like automatically going to roll into the next live stream. So that's that's why I got I did that, but you were getting off yesterday. Yeah, exactly. I thought you were hooking me with the um with the old cane, but I'm glad to hear that you weren't. And thank you so much everybody. These are amazing questions. It's been really really fun to hang out with you this hour. Yeah, thank you all. And thank you Megan and Annie for putting this presentation together and all the amazing work you do. Thank you to Laser for organizing all of Learnathon. Thank you to all of you. There's no there is no Complexity without the community that surrounds it. So, this is so special. So, thank you all for being here and don't forget to check out more of what's going on at complex at complexitylearnathathon.com and laser put this in the chat, but you can join at complexity.storepagesathon to keep crash course free forever. And JB, you missed the whole thing. You got to be here for the very end. Um, so I'm so glad you joined and this will be uploaded later. So if you came in late or just want to watch it again, you can watch this later. Um, and I believe it'll be on youtube.com/complexity. Thank you all for joining us. Thanks Megan and thanks everybody. Y [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",crash course writing workshop,"music   music   music   music   music  oh, hello. i was making notes. hello. i'm kaitlin hoffmeister. thank you so much for coming to learnathon. happy learnathon. and welcome to the crash course writing workshop. this crash course workshop is brought to you by executive acting executive producer and editorial director megan mafairy and crash course script editor annie fillinworth. i'm caitlyn hoffmeister. i'm the former executive producer of sihow and now a freelance producer and writer. i also have the pleasure this coming semester of teaching post-production and science writing at the university of idaho. and behind the scenes today is the amazing mastermind behind all of learnathon, laser weber. thank you laser for running everything. um, in just a minute i'm going to hand the reins of this conversation over to megan and annie. but before i do, i want to give you a sense of what to expect. so megan and annie built this workshop based on the frequent questions they get around how a crash course is researched, written, and edited. and so they're going to walk us through each of those different steps involved in that. and if you have questions throughout, please add them in the chat and i will ask megan and annie on the side or laser will throw them up so they can ask answer those questions in real time as we go through or potentially we'll save them for the end if that's a better time for some of them. um, and now all three of us on this chat are on this call are very used to making things for the internet. um, so of course that means we love love youtube comments. um, so in presentations like this it can feel kind of weird because we can't see you. so we would love you to be really active in the chat. if you are excited about something and if we could see you and we could see you like leaning in, wanting to know more about something, we would probably like shift how we're presenting the information. so if you're having a lean-in moment and you want megan or annie to slow down and talk more about something, let us know in the chat. if you're confused, like if we could be able to see your furrowed brow and be like, ""is that making sense?"" let's explain it another way, go ahead and put like a question mark or say, ""could you repeat in the in the chat?"" um, both laser and i will be watching the chat closely throughout this. um, and now um and then if you're just excited about something, share that. we would love it. um, and so as i hand this over to megan and annie now to introduce themselves, please if you could introduce yourself in the chat, hopefully you're doing that already a bit. um, share where you're watching from. share if you've watched any other learnathon content this month. um, and without further ado, let me introduce you to megan and annie from the crash course team. awesome. thank you so much, kaitlyn. who are these people? i uh, i'll start. my name is megan mafairy. i've been at crash course for about 3.5 years. and up here on this slide are a few photos that represent moments on my journey before i came to crash course. so, um, going from right to left, uh, because that's an ordinary direction to go in. uh, at in the right you'll see a picture of me at georgetown. that's where i got my master's degree. uh, i studied english with a focus on the environmental humanities. basically, what i focused on was how we tell stories that help us make sense of climate change and how climate change sort of complicates the way that we used to tell stories and the way that we should tell stories about the future. uh, and when i was in grad school, i was able to make a podcast instead of a thesis. and then later, i got to interview with hank and talk about my podcast as part of getting this job. so that's a story i always love to tell when i give when i talk to folks who are like trying to move into a different part of their career. i say just like do your best to make the kind of things that you want to be making. and that was a really really big moment for me um where it it panned out and i was i was so pleased. um, so before that i was at national geographic, um, and i was working on educational programs for teachers who were interested in, um, including more environmental and cultural literacy in all different types of subjects they taught. and uh the leftmost photo represents a moment uh right at the very beginning, very early in my career when i was working as a public radio producer uh for a little show in north carolina. it was a daily live talk show. and a big part of my job was to research the topic of conversation before uh before the show happened live and to brief the host about what what everything was going to be about. um, and in this particular conversation, we were talking about a new exhibit at our local science museum that was focused on um, spittlebugs. this bug that you see here in the picture, uh, they like surround themselves with this spit-like casing. and i was just telling the host all about the different scientific reasons behind this. and uh there was this like really this moment i always remember where um my boss interrupted me and she goes, ""wow, you love science."" and i was like, ""what? i don't no, i don't. i i had never thought about myself as a person who loved science. you know, from a young age, i felt like i was sort of an english social studies type person."" and uh i it was a moment and but she was like, ""no, listen to the enthusiasm in your voice. you love science."" and it was just a moment that really opened my eyes and made me think about how much further science can resonate when it's focused on stories and the excitement of discovery. and that was a big influential moment that i i think about all the time now doing what we do here at crash course. uh, and now i'll let annie tell some stories about her journey. yeah. so, hi, i'm annie fillenworth. um, i've been at complexity for three years. three amazing years. really made so many great things in that time. um, and yeah, my background is in creative writing. um, i studied creative writing in undergrad at fairley dickson university in new jersey. i'm based in philly now. yes, that is city hall the night the eagles won the super bowl. go birds. um, and then i earned my masters at the new school in new york city. those are some of our illustrious alums of the writing for children and young adult program like jenny han and danielle clayton. um, had a really amazing experience there. and then, um, i graduated into the pandemic. um, which is, you know, no one's ideal scenario. um, but i spent that time also like making things that i wanted to see. so, i um started a podcast with my friend jill where we talked about um movies and tv shows for kids from the 2000s. i published some of my own work and i got my first big girl job as an editor at a small puzzle books company uh in suburban the suburban philadelphia area. um and then i started working at crash course. so, i got to sort of use a lot of my different skills and niche interests um in this job and i've worked on a bunch of shows um under the illustrious guidance of megan. awesome. thank you both. um so, yeah, if you i'm going to ask i'm going to ask a question for the chat first, but then i would love it if you both could tell us how a crash course script gets made. and for all of you watching at home, thank you for telling me where you're from. massachusetts girly. go birds. um, how many people do you think the average crash course script goes through before production? we tend to talk about steps and there's pre-production, production, when it's filmed, and post-production. so, but within each of those steps, there's a lot going on. so, if you have any guesses about how many people you think the average crash grow script touches before it goes to be filmed with the host, go ahead and make your guesses in the chat and megan and annie will teach us that along the way. awesome. so, i'm going to talk a little bit about what makes a crash course script. um, you know, what exactly is the special sauce of of a crash course script? and, um, the first thing is that it needs to be accurate. um, anytime you're making educational materials or tools, that's the bottom line is that we have to be as accurate as possible. so, the crash course scripts go through lots of people to make sure that our scripts are as accurate as possible. we use um primary sources and peer-reviewed research. we have fact checkers, experts in the field. um, and we also share our sources for each of the videos in the description to make sure we're as transparent as possible. um, so that's like the main thing, but then also you might know that like we have a crown coursey tone and um that comes from trying to be clear, engaging, and inclusive. so we try to make our videos as accessible as possible and not use too much jargon, you know, define terms when we have them. um, but make sure it's like simple language that feels everyday and conversational and that is engaging in the way a conversation with a friend would be. we like to learn alongside the viewer rather than simply teach. um, and our videos also answer the so what. so, we talk about a lot in editorial spaces, which is we're learning something, but why does it matter? why should the viewer care that u we're learning this information? and that really guides and propels both the series and each individual script. um, and we also build around narrative. um, storytelling is really essential to crash course and it helps us remember the things we learn and put them into context with our daily lives. so, we'll talk much more about narrative in a second, but um, our next um, quality is that all our scripts are entirely original. we do not use ai in any of our creative work. um, and we make sure everything is crystal clear, not plagiarized. um any script you hear recited by the host has been um made by humans which we really pride ourselves in. um and our scripts also treat our audience with honesty, nuance and care. we want to really imagine that our audience are the complex people that they are and try to showcase stories um and also like hypothetical scenarios that feel like they represent a wide variety of people. and so how does this all start? um once we have a series green lit, the first step is to sort of envision what the series might look like. and so that starts with a brainstormed episode list. we often enlist the help of a subject matter expert who can help us figure out what do we want all the episodes to be about? um how do we want to convey the information? what are some possible hooks and stories that we could use to express that information? and so this takes a bit of iteration trying to figure out, you know, how many episodes makes the most sense, what do we want to talk about in each one and sort of a lot of brainstorming happens at this stage. and after that, we create a syllabus. so if you've ever taken a college class, you know, the first day of class, your professor shows up and hands you a piece of paper that details what the whole course is going to cover. and that's what we use as sort of an internal guide for um our for our our videos um and to help our writers uh script their uh videos. so the syllabus is basically a really fleshed out episode list. we have things like the course description, the learning objectives, and then we break down each script um topic into subtopics and put in all of the actual concrete information that we want to convey. so, we'll have things like key terms, but also fun stuff like special segments or also misconceptions we want to make sure that we address or don't fall into. um, and then that is sort of the framework that the writer uses to create their first draft. and so that takes a lot of research on their part, looking through all of the uh sources that are linked in the syllabus and figuring out how to build a story around that information. and so after that it goes through many rounds of edits including through me through megan and eventually after going through a fact checker and a producer and the host it becomes a real actual video. um shout out to latin american literature which is airing now. okay so here's the answer to the question. a it does range, but somewhere around 8 to 10 plus people work on every crash course script. and that's just the script. you should more than double it once you start to get into the video elements and the animation elements. sometimes we have uh you know illustrator like for native american history, we have illustrators who are from indigenous cultures and things like that. and then that um that adds more and more collaborators which is is something that uh is so fun and and rewarding for us and we hope it is for the audience as well. um so i'm going to show you i know you can't see this. uh and i kind of wanted to show it to you this way just to emphasize like it doesn't fit on a slide. the crash course script process is so elaborate it doesn't really fit on a slide. but i am going to sort of um zoom in for you and show you a a high level of our full sort of flowchart of how a crash course script gets made. um so i'm going to try to zoom in. um basically we start once yeah like annie said once we decide to make a series the first thing we do is we hire a subject matter expert. that's going to take a few months. then we move into a sort of curriculum development phase. so, we're taking several weeks to develop an episode list, like a highlevel outline, like she talked about. then, we're taking several more weeks to fill out that outline with sources, with story ideas, etc. if we have a funding partner, of course, there's back and forth during that part. um, finally, once the syllabus is complete, we move into scripting. and i don't expect you i'm just sort of taking you through this just to give you a sense of the scope. obviously, there's not going to be a pop quiz at the end. um but yeah, then we move into a first draft. we have our subject matter expert review every single draft to make sure that we've gotten everything right at a high level. we have uh multiple edits. so first we have like a developmental edit which is more focused on story and priorities. you know, did we spend enough time on one thing and too much time on another thing? things like that. then we have the the lead editor do a second edit. um and then uh things get passed to different types of stakeholders. the script gets passed to different types of stakeholders. so, we send the script to our producers and our producers are really focused on like like i always tell this story that one time um in our religion series, we had an introduction that was about uh a small community who experienced what felt to this community at this church like to be a miracle. and it was that there was a painting on their church and it it like started dripping oil and they were like, ""this is a miracle, a modern miracle."" um, and i was like, ""oh, this is such an exciting place to start the script."" and the producer was like, ""okay, but what are they going to see on screen? it's lit. it's a wall. you want you want people to look at a wall, just a blank a wall. it it's it's as it's almost paint drying. that's what you're asking for."" so, the producers bring a really different perspective than what we might be thinking about on the editorial side, and that's really helpful. we also have our host review the scripts and change up little jokes and references to make it more personal to them. and then fact check, copy edit. so that's when we go back through to make sure um you know just polish everything, make sure we're not being too redundant, make sure everything feels sensitive. and then finally we get to the table read which is a sort of a rehearsal with our host. but i will move off of this annoying and difficult to look at figma board. um and move back to our deck if i can. let's see. cool. and i feel like now is a great time while you while you do that, megan, looking at all those people on all those stages. um i just want to thank crash course is free. uh crash course is free for everyone and is meant to be accessible. and so i want to thank shannon alexander and tia hazard for donating. this part of the reason we're doing this for learnathon is to make sure that crash course will always be free. so, thank you all for being here and thank you for for supporting what what these guys do. um, cool. and so, oh, can you still hear me? i just lost one headphone. um, so moving forward, annie, you had mentioned that we're going to talk more about narrative. um, and so let's go ahead and talk that. how do you take this commitment to accuracy, all this research that you're doing, and then turn it into a compelling story that people are going to not only be interested in watching, but also that will help stay in their minds? and um i just before i actually pass it over to you, uh some questions that came up that are related to that is do you follow like a certain kind of style guide um and how does that interact with with that process? yeah, we have our own style guide that we sort of adhere to, but it's also sort of in flux. we don't necessarily we're not strictly ap or chicago or anything like that. also, because the information is imparted verbally, so you can't really see the text anyway, but we do have a style guide that helps us keep things in order um on our end. awesome. uh so yeah, big big picture we something we really think about when we're trying to figure out how to make it all a story. uh we ask ourselves the these three questions. what am i learning that i didn't know before? what's making me feel something? and what's my genuine journey of discovery? um almost all of the time our writers are not experts on the subject. and so when we give them this these syllabi, they are genuinely reading information, digesting things, synthesizing information for the first time, learning a lot of things for the first time. and that means that we get frustrated sometimes. we get confused. we're grasping for like analogies and metaphors to try to latch on to something we already know. and then sometimes those fall apart and we have to start again. that whole process of learning um it happens to us and every time we try to write a crash course script and you know when you grow up when you go to school you learn to hide that whole part of the writing process and just document okay i've sorted it out and let me put the clean and finished part on the page but what we try to do is really hold on to what were the highs and lows of my journey to understanding this information what were the twists and turns the moments where i fell into a misconception or got confused and how did i sort of resolve that and we try to build a story from that. um, and i i think this is like an extremely nerdy thing to say, but i i think i can prove it to you. um that it it seems crazy to say that we would we take our journey of discovery and make it like a plot, but um i'm going to show you how we you can really layer a crash course script onto this is like a common plot structure. i pulled this from the legendary comedy training center upright citizens brigade. this is their um this is like an adapted version of their plot structure for like a tv show pilot, like a comedy tv show pilot. but i'm going to show you how um a crash course script defining and the nerdy concept of what is a species actually kind of fits into this tv pilot format. um so we'll start with fun. open with something fun, interesting, and relatable. so this is an example from a real crash course script. a sleepy bassad hound and a tireless border collie look and act like they're from different planets, but they can have a weird looking litter of puppies that can make more puppies. that's because they're the same species. but meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. but sadly, that source can't have more zorse babies because horses and zebras are different species. so okay, organis two organisms are considered members of the same species if they can mate and make fertile offspring. okay, but we encounter a frustration right off the bat. life has been known to break these rules. like there are some hybrids that can reproduce. you might know some of them without knowing you know them. like if you've ever had a plumcot from the grocery store, but there are also hybrid animals that can reproduce, including this hybrid lizard species. uh, and females actually don't even need a mate to do so. so, that completely breaks the definition of species that i just gave to you. we've hit a snag. we've hit our first conflict in our plot. okay. well, then the next the next part of the story structure is having a a new plan, a false victory. okay. so, because of exceptions like the plumcot and that lizard, uh, other scientists think it's better to define species by their genealogy. according to this idea, all organisms in the same evolutionary lineage are one species. oops. but that gets complicated for a bunch of reasons, including that there are literally billions of extinct species that are pretty tough to learn about and to link with living ones. so, this concept really isn't perfect either. and we really things escalate. we fall into chaos with our plot when we also consider, okay, here's another way to think about species. uh what if we parse them based on environmental conditions like how polar bears live in a different type of habitat than grizzly bears? well, that starts to fall apart as soon as you consider any number of species that live in more than one environment. and at this point, we might want to level with our audience. we say, if all of this feels confusing to you, you're actually on to something. in real life, it's really difficult to pin down what makes a species. and every single definition of species that scientists have come up with is imperfect. but we still have to resolve it somehow. uh and ultimately we land on well humans make knowledge by categorizing things even if those categories aren't as rockolid as we wish they were. um so our systems for naming and classifying things are totally imperfect and at the same time super super useful. having working death species definitions lets us compare and contrast things notice what they have in common. but it's also really really interesting when those things break and that helps us learn more about the world and about how nature works. awesome. thanks megan. um and if any questions come up feel free to drop them in the chat. um, and yes, that we had talked earlier about the different steps and writing, research and writing, and now we're getting to editing some of the invisible work that goes into this. um, and then we had a question from earlier. i just want to highlight um that came up from tass. thank you, tass, for asking this. and as you're telling us more about editing, annie, if you want to tell us, does crash course have a plagiarism check used to make sure that someone's not accidentally plagiarizing or maybe one of your writers is is plagiarizing? and what is your process for dealing with potential potential plagiarism and the editing process? yeah, that's a great question. um, towards the end of the editing process, we run through all of our scripts uh through grammarly. they have a great plagiarism check function um that checks it alongside many many many pages and documents on the internet. um and fortunately we have like a lot of people with good integrity on our team. so i don't know if we've ever come across anything that's been remotely close. sometimes it might be like this sentence is really close to this sentence and then it's like a quote. um, so sometimes you might need to like reward a sentence if it just came too close to an original source, but the vast majority of the time there are no problems. um, especially because of how many edits we go through, it's just so far from the source by then that plagiarism isn't really a concern. but, uh, if there ever were a concern, we would probably address it pretty swiftly. um, but fortunately, i haven't run into that problem. um, but yeah, we can get started talking about editing. so, something we thought might be a good idea to talk about today is specifically editing a crash course intro. um, intros are super important. the first 30 seconds are essential to a video. if you're uh you've ever uploaded anything to youtube, you know about how long it takes for a view to count. and then also it's what helps us get the attention right away, get it engaged, and then move through and set up the rest of the video. um, so yeah, the first 30 seconds are super important. and we're going to um talk about some of the common pitfalls that we see when we are editing um crash courseware scripts. so, the first common issue is when an intro meanders. um, so you can pull up that intro, megan. um, so this is an original intro for a script for crash course sexed. and the first thing you might notice is that it's pretty long for 30 seconds. it's kind of a lot of information. um, and it's covering a lot of great stuff in context, but that's not usually what the function of the intro is. we're more trying to grab attention. an intriguing concept or question. and so a lot of this information is stuff that would better suit later on in the script. um, even the fun joke we have at the end about how to pronounce lgbtqia, it's not quite going to hit in an intro. so we decided to take things in a different direction for our edited version. and so where we came to was talking about our host sham's first crush. so, first crushes are a pretty common experience and we're able to relate to the audience and have them reflect on their own experiences by starting there. and also, it's kind of juicy. like, it's a little bit gossipy. it's got that fun big sister feel that we were really shooting for with our host for sex ed. um, and so we just sort of connected some barebones ideas and then allowed shan to come in and add her personal experiences. and that really lightened the tone. it kind of brought us into a very complex idea which is what is sexuality um by talking about something really relatable and easy to understand and um added some punchy questions to get us into the rest of the script. so the next common issue is burying the lead. so obviously when we're we have an intro we want to start with a punch and this story is super interesting from native american history. we're talking about a tribe that was arguably very successful and then something happened. they got terminated by the federal government and things really went downhill very quickly for them. um, so it's a really interesting story, but honestly the most interesting part is the sentence right before chang's introduction where he says uh at the dawning of the termination era that's exactly what makes them a target. so we thought why don't we move some things around to try to make this um more interesting. so in our final version, we started with that idea, shifted it to the top and said things were looking up for the monomony tribe of wisconsin and that's exactly what made them a target. so immediately we feel a little bit more suspense, a little bit more intrigue just by moving one sentence and then we keep that same context, but now we have a reason to be interested and then just kind of put a bow on it at the end by saying, you know, the monomony had a safety net, but it was about to break. so, we're able to really build suspense in um the intro just by shifting a few parts around. um and our oh, go ahead, kayla. um awesome. just nope, you keep going. i will i'll add this one next. i thought i thought there was natural pause. you keep going. sorry. right. no worries. um and uh our last common issue that we'll talk about today is when there isn't enough feeling. so, intros, part of what makes them grabby is um connecting to human emotion. and so this is from an episode of crash course religions about cults. and it's fun. it's got a great light-hearted tone, a sort of, you know, relatable concept of what do we think of when we think of the word cults. um, but it's a little bit generic and it could probably pack a little bit more of a punch. so, we decided to shake things up a little bit in our edited version where we sort of put the viewer themselves into a scenario. we said, ""picture this. you're in a cozy room surrounded by people welcoming you with good food and kindness. they're showing interest in your questions, your anxieties, and you hold on a second. is this a cult? so, it sort of, you know, lulls the viewer into a sense of safety and comfort and then disrupts that immediately that sort of counterintuition is something we often use in our episodes. um, and also it tackles that kind of relatable question that a lot of people ask themselves, which is like, would i fall for a cult? it's kind of a an intriguing juicy question. um, and then we tacked on a bit of a punchier end to that as well by saying, can we really tell the difference between a religion and a cult? so, we sort of tightened things up and made them a little bit more packing a punch. um, and just heightened it. you know, the original intro was fine and great, but we were able to make it even better. and so, you know, these are just intros, but we apply a lot of these same tactics to the rest of the script as well to make things engaging by adding hypothetical scenarios and jokes and personal reflections from the host. all these things can kind of tie together the whole episode. um, but the intro is where that sort of shines right at the start. awesome. thanks, annie. and then a question that came up um that was sort of timely when talking about sexed is from rachel and rachel's question is did theme um but i think this was actually about the host because sometimes the subject matter expert and the host are different people. um but did the host write the intro about their crush or did a writer write it from their perspective? and i feel like that leads in really nicely to this next section about balancing all that information with making it fun and funny. um, and then just want to add one more question on there because lucy lid sort of anticipated this next coming up as well and asked, ""do you have any advice or resources converting complicated educational materials in a conversational tone?"" i think you'll kind of answer this one naturally, but just wanted to put those out there as you're as you're talking about this next one. yeah, and i can speak to that. yeah, that sex ed intro. um, yeah, so sham was our host. we had a different subject matter expert. um, but we did um sort of build a framework. sometimes we'll we'll write a section of a script where we say something like in brackets, you know, tk, which is the sort of journalist uh shortand for to come. um, uh, host experiences. so i think what we had in our sort of intervening episode uh uh edit of this um intro was you know my first crush name um and then something etc etc and then uh i think we had sort of added the stuff about being boy obsessed and boy bands because we had also talked to shan um before we started scripting about her personality and experiences so we could sort of fill in a little bit of the gaps with what we already knew about her and then she was able provide the specifics later. so, the hosts definitely have um a chance to add their sort of flare to the episodes um as they review them before we ship them. yeah. and i would say i think my best advice for making complicated information easy to understand is really um tr what it was like when you first learned it. and that can be really hard if you know it really well. but if you can put yourself back in in that space of learning something fresh and what surprised you, what subverted your expectations, what confused you, then i think that helps. um, i think oftentimes when we know something really well, we skip a lot of steps in explaining it because they just seem obvious. and if you can like think back to, you know, sitting in that freshman year classroom where something really hooked you for the first time um and and try to or or if you can't like talk to a person who doesn't know about it, i think is really good advice. we often if in some cases if we do have an expert writer, it's all the more important that we don't have an expert editor. we we always want uh lay someone who's editing the script to be a lay person relative to the script subject matter. thankfully, that's really easy at crash course because we do a crash course on every possible subject and no one can be an expert on every possible subject. but yeah, i would say making sure someone is is genuinely learning it for the first time uh can react to that to your work on it and that helps a lot. okay, i'm going to click back forward. i had took us back to that um intro when we were talking about that. but this is another big question we get about making things fun and funny. and i'm going to talk a little bit about here about just like how we think about humor here at crash course. um so i'll start with just some like basic principles of humor writing that are true for any type of humor writing. the first is that quantity is the key to quality. the best comedy writers invisibly write dozens and hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, but you only see the best ones. and so sometimes we're really hard on ourselves uh because we're like, man, i wrote five jokes and they're all bad. um but that's because we're imagining we're not imagining the intense failure rate that real comedians are experiencing and just filtering before it gets to us. um, related to that, we work hard on our team to make space for there to be a clown mode and an edit mode. and what i mean by that is that we try to create space in clown mode where we don't judge ourselves where we say the bad idea because maybe the bad idea will spark something in someone else that leads to a good idea. and if we never say the bad idea, then we never get to the quantity, which is the key to the quality, right? like you got to clear out all the bad ideas in order to make space for the good ideas. and um yeah, then later there's edit mode where you are identifying, okay, this one joke out of the 50 options is the best one and you're culling. and these are incredibly self- sustaining. you can only be brave enough to and vulnerable enough to have a clown mode if you know that later there will be the edit mode so your bad ideas won't be showcased. you know these are you really need both uh in order to have like a successful humor team. um and the other thing i would say is take stock of your toolbox. um there are all kinds of humor tools. um humor is very very often formulaic. it's based on repeated and predictable techniques that are going to work again and again in new contexts. um, and so just to give you some examples, i there are different different types of toolboxes that everybody can have based on your unique context. um, so i'll tell you a little bit about the crash course toolbox for humor. one question we ask ourselves if we feel like something is not funny enough is, can we add some physical action? for us, uh, the cra the expectation of the viewer is that the host is going to be sitting at the desk. they're a talking head. so, anytime we can put them in a new space or interacting with the world in a new way, that's going to surprise people and that adds an element of humor. um, so in this case, in native american history, we're talking about busting myths about about native american people. and um rather than just talking about that as a metaphor, we took it real literally and we have him putting the myths into a bottle and then smashing them with a bat. um, so fun. uh, another thing we ask ourselves is would it help to have a character say it? again, both of these are these are pretty sensitive examples. um, here's uh this is from the religions series. uh, and we wanted to think about how can we talk about religious misconceptions which are essentially they're stereotypes about people, sometimes marginalized groups. um how can we talk about those um but not in a way that feels overly preachy or judgmental. and it really helped to add a character. so we had created this character called the devil's advocate. we had him facetime john um our host and wear a tracksuit and a headset and just be like the least likable person um so that we could then correct those misconceptions in a more playful way. another thing uh ties right back to what annie was talking about with our sexed um intro example earlier, but it's one thing if that if that intro had been focused on um we all have crushes. that's fine. but uh a good comedy principle is like it's better to have don't talk about a scene somewhere in the future or somewhere in the past. bring bring it to here. bring it make it more specific and bring it to here. so we're talking about devon. we're talking about shan's crush, devon. devon is in the room with us and that really helps a lot. visuals and sound effects. we love oh, we love a christopher columbus with a single tear down his cheek. we love uh hashtag team jacob. little little visual or sound effect moments that can punch up a video. camera angles and video editing techniques. here you have chay making a joke about um the the words that he prefers to refer to himself as. he likes the word indigenous. he also likes the words handsome and brave. and we get a little bit of a closeup and a side angle to show that he's being a little cheeky. um cool. i just uh i want to check on the timing. caitlyn, are we are we having a lot of questions? should i? we have um we have about 15 minutes left and we i have a decent list of questions we could go over. um and but yeah, let's see. um i think is it is the exercise you want to do about three minutes? is that right? yeah, sure. we could do that exercise. yeah, i think we could do that. um maybe we can. yeah, let's walk us. yeah, go for it. has a an exercise for us that we can do before we get into more questions. yeah. yeah. so, one really really easy tip for making a joke a little bit better is putting the funny part last. and you may have heard of the rule of three, uh, which is a really good example of putting the funny part last. so, the rule of three is a type of joke where you create a pattern or expectation and then you immediately break it. so the audience thinks they know what's coming and then you immediately break it. so in this case we have i love christmas. what's not to love? presents, family, and the crushing realization that the joy of childhood is gone forever, right? it's it's just like a very simple formula that anyone anyone can come up with and you can you can play with again and again. so i did want to do a little chat challenge. um i'd love to challenge you to write a joke in three minutes using the rule of three. um and i'm going to give you a prompt. the prompt is birthday parties. and the way you're going to do this is you're going to just take i will set a timer. kaitlyn will set a timer for 3 minutes. you're going to make a list of things that pop into your head that go with birthday parties. but and then you're going to have to think of one thing that relates to birthday parties but sparks a really different feeling than the rest. so the format could be like birthday parties are great, normal thing, normal thing, weird thing. and then we'd love to see your answers in the chat. uh this is clown mode. so we're all brave because one another is brave, right? uh we're all on a limb together. there is bad ideas are going to are going to get us to good ideas. so i challenge you to be vulnerable with us. uh and we'll set a timer for three minutes. all right, timer's going. we are in kind of quiet mode. if you have a piece of paper or your computer in front of you, go ahead and start start writing writing down your ideas. thank you so much for aunt crystal for getting us started with that very quickwitted uh example. and i'll bring us back from this quiet mode gently in about a minute in about two and a half minutes.  music   music   music   music  hey,  music  hey, hey.  music  all right, i'm going to bring us back. thank you all so much for dropping these. megan and annie, do you want to read a couple that stood out to you and maybe talk about them? these are all i don't feel like there were any duds. you all are so funny. they're all so good. you're so funny. i i'm the first one i i'm gonna see if i can find it. h candles cake and a candycoated realization that you're hurdling toward death. so good. so, i candycoated realization. so good. i love it. i love it. annie, did you have a favorite? yeah, i i really liked um jen marker's birthday parties are great. cake, friends, and watching people sing to you while you sit silently. so true. so true. so relatable. i also just want to shout out ellipsu. it's ellipsu's 18th birthday tomorrow. so, happy birthday. i'm so glad you're spending part of your birthday week with us. yes. happy birthday. happy birthday. you guys are so brave. thank you for thank you for playing with us. it was really really fun to see your jokes. um i'll just we'll just quickly wrap up and then we'll transition into slidesh into more faqs. um we saw this in your joke examples, but other ways to finaness a joke is to think about contrast. um, so in the i love christmas joke example, having the presents the be as far as possible away from the joy of childhood being gone forever. if it was like presents, family, and like being a little tired, then that's not that's not as funny because the contrast is too small. i think that i think the person who wrote about candy coded h hurtling toward death intuitively understood that that was a good contrast. um, another thing is being being more specific. um, so a specific detail is always funnier than a broad description. that's why i think we've all heard this in different circumstances. it's always funny to just like give a character a random name. thanks a lot, robert. do we know who robert is? doesn't matter. it's just funny because sudden it's more specific. um, so these are just kind of quick quick um joke improvements. and the last thing i would always say is ask your friends. humor is social. there's nothing harder than sitting with a page by yourself trying to be funny. there's nothing more depressing. um, but with people, uh, really really helps and that's that's what we do here on the crash course team and here with you today. so, thank you so much. awesome. awesome. thank you. um, so yeah, now we're gonna we have about 10 more minutes, little little less. so, we have time to talk about your questions. some of you have already put some in the chat, which thank you so much. um, if you have more, feel free to drop them in. and if you have more jokes, feel free to drop them in. um, so the first one i wanted to start with is from finara, and you've talked about this a little bit, but i love the specificity of this question too, and thought you um, we could talk about it a little bit more. so, for influential but problematic figures in a topic, for example, salvador dolli in art history, how do you decide what to explain about them and what to admit for time or clarity? or what are some other ways potentially that you bring up that topic like you were talking about with um with some other series? would megan or annie you want to take it? go for it annie. sure. um yeah and and megan feel free to add your thoughts too. um this is something we talk about all of the time um because unfortunately there are a lot of problematic figures that uh we learn about various topics. um i think part of it has to do with tone. we try not to sort of valorize those people um or overly praise them for their contributions. sometimes we'll just present it factually. um and it's really a case- by case basis. sometimes it feels relevant to say and by the way this person is not great for xyz reason or you know keep in mind this other thing. um, and also sometimes it's about really letting them be a footnote and talking about somebody else who um doesn't have as scarred a reputation uh is from a marginalized background or an underrepresented community um because a lot of their contributions tend to not be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. so sometimes there's room to say um this person in science was a eugenicist. so take everything they say with a grain of salt. but this person over here was doing something really interesting with dna or something like that where we can sort of highlight news stories from people that we don't know about. um but also sometimes it's even just a footnote in the description like we're aware that this person is iffy because of xyz reason a resource to learn more about it. so it really depends on the scenario i think. awesome. and then finn brener just asked, ""does a host ever make changes to the script on set?"" in my experience, i've never had that not happen. uh but i' which we love our hosts for that. uh um and but i wondered too if you could talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk more about the um the read through um the table and and that process and how that helps with that. yeah, we have a lot of structures in place to try to help the host give input a number of times before we're on set because we used to have the host make more changes on set and we're really open to it because that's when a lot of playfulness can come out, but um we've fact checked everything and sometimes things are so so subtle and you lose the word 'the' and suddenly it's not exactly correct anymore. and um so it's hard to like kind of flag those things on the spot. so, uh, a couple of things we do, like annie alluded to earlier, one thing we do, um, is when we have a new host, we have like an interview with them where we talk about like what are your embarrassing stories? what's your family like? do you have pets? what's a weird opinion you have about the world? um, so we try to get, you know, an understanding of what makes them tick. and then we we write some jokes with them and with that in mind. and with then we leave we also leave a lot of uh placeholders for them. um, like annie mentioned, um, then they review the scripts in advance. they fill in the placeholders. we encourage them to react to other parts of the script as well. so, we often get new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for um, you know, anecdotes, things like that um, at that stage. and then, yeah, then we do what we call a table read. it's it's a remote table read. we're all around a virtual table, but there's going to be the producer, the script editor, and the host all in a room reading through the scripts. and in those moments, um, we notice when the host, if they stumble repeatedly over a line, then it's probably the line, it's probably not them. um, so we'll take a moment and we'll revise that line to make it sound more natural for them. um, also those are moments where sometimes if a joke doesn't quite land in real time, we'll we'll toss the ball around trying to make the joke a little bit funnier. um, if something or just something feels wrong, um, then we'll make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. um then yeah, when we get on set, we can never and we would never want to fully um get rid of host changes on set, but we try to have like one word perfect recording and then one recording with improvisations. so that way if later when we're going through uh we notice that there's a factual discrepancy, we have a take with the word perfect version that we can substitute in for that portion. thank you. um, cool. and then we had a couple questions about working with fact checker fact checkers and subject matter experts. so, i'm just going to read a couple of them and and we can have a little bit of a conversation about it. so, syjoy asks, ""hi, syd. hi, jacqueline. is there anything you do in the writing process to make it easier for the fact checker, especially if info is from the subject matter expert and not a primary reference?"" what what happens in that situation. and then sarah j also asked, ""how many subject matter experts do you reach out to when fact-checking and developing the script? does it vary by topic?"" yeah, i can jump in. um, yeah, factchecking is is its own animal. um, but part of what our scripting process is like is is keeping the sources with the claims as long as possible in the script version. so the way that we sort of structure scripts literally from the first draft that the writer does is that the last punctuation of a sentence, we have a comment in our google doc where they link the source and the the sort of text from that source where that claim came from. and so those comments are all visible to the fact checker when they go in and do their fact check and they're finding independent sources that back those claims up. so, we're able to sort of give them a place of like this is where this idea came from. um, the fact checker might be able to say, ""hey, that source is actually outdated or there's a newer paper that has more accurate information now or that was debunked a while ago."" um, and so we can sort of keep track of where the claims came from. um, and yeah, we always have the subject matter expert that we have sort of developed the series with from day one. um, but we also might bring in other people who have specific areas of expertise. this happened a lot with um, religions and native american history. so, when there's particular groups or experiences that we want to make sure that um, we're getting right, but the subject matter expert is more of a generalist. so, that kind of um, yeah, very serious series to series. awesome. thanks, annie. and i think this might be our last question, but before we move on, i wanted to shout out brooke in the chat who also mentioned script supervisors. thank you, brooke, for asking about that. and then thank you again to all of for all of you for being here. and thank you to those of you who donated to help make sure crash course is always free for everyone. um, and so this is two questions um that i'm grouping together kind of like i did with the fact checker. is um is about visuals. katie hoben early on asked, ""could you tell us more about how you think about explanation versus animation in your courses? what type of content is best supported by visual assets?"" and then lucy lids asked, ""when writing the script, do you include visual descriptions as you go or later?"" yeah, this is these are really good questions. um when we think about animation we i mean we have to think about it any anybody would from like a sort of budget perspective. animation is in and illustration is incredibly resource intensive. we have incredible um animators and illustrators here uh on the crash course team. shout out to them. um so we do have to look at a script and think about like what are the parts that are the most difficult to understand without a really clear visual. and usually that is either that they're very technical um so we're thinking like the parts of the cell or something like that where you you know you can't keep track of there's what 30 different organels you can't you just can't put that in your head um or very very abstract um so if we're thinking about like uh you know like uh the origin stories of hinduism or something like that um that are we don't ne that the average viewer might not necessarily necessarily have um anything to bring up in their imagination when we come up with it. then we need to put something on screen to mix up make it a little bit more concrete. or with our political theory series, when we talk about like liberalism or another philosophical concept, we have to kind of take something abstract and make it concrete often with a metaphor or a character or sometimes just like a graphic organizer like a ven diagram or a chart or something like that. that helps us keep track of we're comparing different concepts. we're thinking of this concept falls within this broader concept and helps the viewers make a mental map. the other thing we think about is the availability of b-roll. um, and oh, i think i think i have to stop talking because we're going to have a nice live stream. but if there's real life, uh, if we can license photographic or video, um, graphics instead of animation, then that helps a lot. and that it does tend to come after the initial script. um just because there's so much content to get through in the initial script that we have a later pass where we're we're thinking more about visuals and it does end up adding some real significant revisions to the script. i just wanted to shout out that we have a whole uh stream coming up about animation and editing in crash course. so, if you're curious about how that stuff happens, uh you should uh join us on wednesday. thank you, laser megan. yeah. so, you don't i just want to flag we are at the half hour when we were scheduled to end. um, so if you were planning your day around this and you have to be in a meeting, thank you so much for coming. um, and then any uh megan, did you get to answer completely? did you feel? yes. yes. i thought that that thank you for sharing that laser. i thought that it was like automatically going to roll into the next live stream. so that's that's why i got i did that, but you were getting off yesterday. yeah, exactly. i thought you were hooking me with the um with the old cane, but i'm glad to hear that you weren't. and thank you so much everybody. these are amazing questions. it's been really really fun to hang out with you this hour. yeah, thank you all. and thank you megan and annie for putting this presentation together and all the amazing work you do. thank you to laser for organizing all of learnathon. thank you to all of you. there's no there is no complexity without the community that surrounds it. so, this is so special. so, thank you all for being here and don't forget to check out more of what's going on at complex at complexitylearnathathon.com and laser put this in the chat, but you can join at complexity.storepagesathon to keep crash course free forever. and jb, you missed the whole thing. you got to be here for the very end. um, so i'm so glad you joined and this will be uploaded later. so if you came in late or just want to watch it again, you can watch this later. um, and i believe it'll be on youtube.com

A place that'll take care of you or destroy you? For centuries, we Latin Americans have recognized Mama Nature's main character energy. She can be kind and generous or dangerous and chaotic. Sounds like a Pisces, am I right? Anyways, in literature, Mama Nature doesn't just spill the tea about plants and animals, water, and rocks. She represents the wildness of people, too. So, what can literature about nature tell us about us? Hi, I'm Kurly Velasquez and this is Crash Course Latin American Literature. [Music] Let's start. A few millennia ago, indigenous people knew Mama Nature first and they knew her well. The people of the Andes called her Bachamama. And the Populvu, the collection of sacred narratives of the Kiche people, name drops their whole natural neighborhood. Macaus, gaka, coyotes, calabash trees, romeilads, and hagarundis. The Incas of what's now Peru regarded the sun as an ancestor and a god, often depicted as a flaming disc with a human face. And to this day, many indigenous peoples view the land as physically and spiritually connected to themselves. It's not just a bunch of rocks and dirt. Fast forward to the late 15th century, and European colonizers were pretty blown away by the Latin American landscape. Christopher Columbus praised the Americas for its soft breezes, high mountains, and fertile lands. Get out of here, Chris. The Spanish botist Gonzalo Fernandez Oedo gushed over everything good to eat there. Iguana delicious prickly pear it'll turn your pee red tmi Gonzalo but the colonizers attitude wasn't on this land we all fam it was more like what's yours is mine for three centuries European colonizers seized control of this vast landscape violently forcing out indigenous peoples and the ways they viewed their environment though to be clear indigenous folks are still very much part of Latin America today and the rest of the world in the 19th century Latin Americans rose up through independence movements transforming colonies into nation states and those nation states had to grapple with big questions like who are we now and who are we going to be in relation to this land. Some 19th century writers like the Venezuelan Chilean poet Andres Beo drew inspiration from the European romantics who tied passionate emotions to the natural world. While living in England, Beo wrote the epic poem Silva Ala agricultura deona toida, agriculture in the torid zone. It oozes with idealism about the landscape back home. Beo addresses the land directly, lovingly even, with lines like, ""You give sweet sugar cane whose pure sap makes the world disdain the honeycomb."" But Beo also claims there's a responsibility involved to place the fertile soil now harsh and wild under the unaccustomed yoke of human skill and conquer it. Keep your yoke away from patcha mama baleo. As the 19th and 20th centuries unfolded, many Latin American writers distanced themselves from the European romantics idealism toward the wilderness. Instead, they invoked the Yanos plains and the pampas grasslands as backwards places. In them, nature wasn't quaint and the jungle wasn't paradise. It was dangerous, menacing, and it held dark secrets about who people really were. Let's get the curly notes on Labor, The Vortex, a 1924 novel by Colombian author Joseio Ria. It's a prime example of regionalism, a style of literature where the place the story occurs is as richly detailed as the characters themselves. Baja Mama isn't just the backdrop for human drama. She is the drama. Lavahina is presented as the diary of a fictional poet named Aruro Kova who fled the city for the Yanos then the jungle and then disappeared without a trace. I mean except this detailed account of everything that went down. And boy did this guy have feelings about the jungle. Oh jungle wed to silence. Mother of solitude and mist. What malignant spirit left me to languish in your emerald prison? Oh jungle, let me escape your sickly shadows, your living cemetery, your primordial kingdom of agony and resuscitation. In Labor, the jungle is one mean place, a vortex of nothingness where humanity falls away and chaos prevails. In the jungle, Koba meets enemies of all kinds. Parasites, leeches, and people enslaving other people through the rubber industry. He finds no kindness, only evil, even in himself. As literary critic Gene Franco puts it, if Lavorina has a message, it is that nature is more powerful than civilization in Latin America. Meaning, not just nature in the literal sense, but also the chaos, wildness, and lawlessness of human nature. Let's move forward in time to the 21st century where we start to see the focus shift to environmental harm. Eco horror is a new genre that explores fractured relationships between humans and the environment through terrifying representations of the natural world. You know, natural disasters, toxic water, aggressive killer hippos, which sidebar, people really aren't as scared of hippos as they should be. They are murderous. Take Argentine author Samantha Schweblin's 2014 book The Stansia de Rescat called Feverdream in its English translation. In the novel, A Mysterious Poison in the Water kills a horse and then nearly kills a 5-year-old boy named David. David survives, but he's changed. Half his spirit has been replaced by something that makes him talk like a grown-up and be just creepy beyond belief. Then when Nenah, a little girl on vacation, also ingests the poison, her mother Amanda becomes desperate for answers. And this story was inspired by real life dangers. Like in the 1990s, people living in the city of Itu Saio became suspicious that there was a link between pesticides and the high rates of cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, and sick kids in their community. So a group of mothers led a door-to-door study, ultimately proving this link. But while some pesticides have been banned in Latin America for their links to health issues, others remain widely used despite scientists debating their safety. Now compare that realworld context to the title of the book. In Spanish, the stansia de rescate translates to rescue distance. That's what Amanda calls the variable distance separating me from my daughter. The implied question is this. If Amanda needs to rescue her daughter right now, can she? How can she protect her child from threats she can't even see? In an interview, Schweblin described the power of eco horror. Fear is what makes you drop a book and run to your computer to Google what is happening and think, ""Can this happen to me? Is this really happening?"" Of course, eco horror isn't the only way contemporary Latin American writers are engaging with environmental damage and exploitation. A new crop of eco poets are highlighting the modern threats of resource extraction, environmental violence, and climate crisis. And they're doing it all in verse. Take the Mapuche poet Ilikura Chiaf, the first indigenous recipient of Chile's National Prize for Literature. He describes how in the Mapuche view, everything in nature has a spirit and is part of a greater infinite. And he often explores this aliveness and interconnectedness in his work. For example, his poem takes on a cyclical structure where each element of the natural world, water, air, earth, fire is dependent on another. They tell me water is life. But what does water do without the air? In question after question, it's clear. You really can't talk about the importance of water without talking about everything else. Because Bacham Mama, she's got her hands in everything. Chihuahua presents a hopeful alternative to eco horror where materialism and environmental degradation are left behind in favor of a more indigenous view of harmony with the earth. Nature has been a source of inspiration for Latin American writers for centuries. And whether they've shown mama nature as a source of wonder, terror, turmoil, or transcendence, those representations often reflect not just the landscape, but the social and political times, too. In our next episode, we'll explore how Latin American literature has drawn inspiration from another source of turmoil, tyrants and dictators. Until then, go show Patchamama some love.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-11-11,2025,619,10.316666666666666,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L2cSifRrLk,"How can native people reclaim their stolen land? In 2020, members of the Honosonyi Confederacy, also known as the Six Nations, occupied an area of land in Calonia, Ontario. They dug trenches, erected concrete barriers, and even blocked a railroad and a highway. The nations were protesting a planned housing development on land they argued was stolen. So, they parked the bus, literally, and renamed the area 1492 Lambag Lane. But did it work? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] Landback. It shows up on t-shirts, billboards, flags, and street art across Indian country. But what does it actually mean? Is it a political movement, a philosophy, a form of protest? Well, it's sort of all of the above. Basically, landback describes any effort by native people to reclaim authority over stolen land and resources. It's a way of asserting tribal sovereignty that inherent right to self-governance. Sometimes landback means suing the government to honor treaties. Other times it means erecting a barricade to keep land developers out. But more on that story in a bit. The landback movement exists because a lot has happened to native land over the past few centuries. It was stolen in a number of ways. through the legal system, broken treaties, and often outright violence. If you want to know more, you can watch basically every episode in this series. In recent years, some private citizens and public figures have tried to call attention to this point through land acknowledgements, where a person or institution publicly states the land they're on was stolen from natives. And while a land acknowledgement can be a good-natured gesture, some natives say it's a hollow one, a way of saying sorry without really doing anything to make amends. In the words of Aphabaskan writer Cena Crowe, indigenous communities need resources, not apologies. Word, Cena. But how landback actually works can vary pretty widely. Like today, some of the land in question is privately owned, but much of it is managed by federal or state governments. In the privatelyowned cases, non-native owners have occasionally offered up the land voluntarily, either through a direct return of the land or by paying tribes a voluntary land tax, sometimes called settler rent. Settler rent is a way for non-native people to transfer wealth back to the people whose land they occupy, just like anyone would pay rent to live on someone else's property. But while Landback is about reclaiming land, organizers explain that the last thing they want to do is repeat the mistakes of colonization by kicking people out of their homes. Like in 2015 when the Pomo tribe bought back 700 acres on the California coast, the seller still lived on the land. So the tribe signed a contract that allowed him to keep living in his family home until his death, even though the Pomo became the technical owners of that land. However, much of the land that native people seek to reclaim isn't owned by individuals. It's owned by federal or state governments, which means that landback often happens through the legal system. Sometimes native nations are able to regain complete control over their land in this way. Other times they agree to share control with the government. That's what happened in 2012 when the Hez PBLO tribe sued the United States over access to the Bayas Calera National Preserve in what's now New Mexico. The tribe argued it had never given up its right to the land there, even though it had been owned by the US since the government bought it from a private owner in 2000. It took 12 years, but in 2024, the two sides reached a settlement. The government agreed to set aside over 3,000 acres within the preserve for the PBLO. And the PBLO agreed to let the US Park Service maintain the land for public use. A win-win. The PBLO could now return to their ancestral home. But the tribe got more than just land in the settlement. They want a chance to revitalize their culture. The governor of the Himes PBLO, Peter Matalina, said that the settlement was crucial to the survival of the trib's traditions. Returning the land to the PBLO gave them the freedom to practice songs and dances tied to that land, which had been part of their culture since well before the US existed. And that's the thing about Lambach. It's not just about the land itself. It's also about reclaiming everything connected to the land, reviving tribal relationships and identity, making space for traditional indigenous world views. And this is especially relevant when it comes to the environment. As we've learned in previous episodes, natives often see the environment as both a gift and a responsibility. We take care of the land and the land takes care of us. So for many natives, widespread pollution and environmental degradation can be traced back to the same problem, colonization. when settlers separated the land from the native people who took care of it. Let me give you an example. For centuries, native Hawaiians had a diverse, self-sufficient food system. On the island of Malayi, native made fish lagoons once fed about a million people. But after Hawaii became a US territory in the late 19th century, millions of acres of land were stolen, and sellers turned much of it into sugarcane and pineapple plantations, destroying or abandoning the fish lagoons in the process. Fast forward to today and you'll find over 80% of Hawaii's food gets imported from elsewhere. And this lack of self-sufficiency in their food system is dangerous. Because if an emergency affected the availability of imports, residents might not have enough to eat. So settles of native culture by changing the environment. They put everyone at risk. For many natives, this complex dilemma has one solution. Landback. At its core, the Lambback movement is about decolonization or undoing the ideas and systems imposed by colonization. Like the ones that decided only sugarcane and pineapple should be grown at the expense of a sustainable food system. Decolonization means understanding that the way things are isn't the way they have to be. Just ask the native activists who are currently working to bring Hawaii's native fish lagoons back. A nonprofit group called Inan Mimona or Fertile Land is leading a community effort to restore the land and teach a new generation of Native Hawaiians sustainable fishing techniques and traditional food practices. And when native folks get land back, it could have wide ranging, even global benefits. In fact, some experts say if we were to increase the forest land maintained by indigenous peoples globally by about 900 million acres in the next 25 years, it would be as impactful as bringing every truck on the road up to modern environmental admission standards. That's a win for all of us. Unfortunately, one of the biggest obstacles the landback movement faces is a slow, tedious legal system. One that was never designed to give land back, only take it away. As we saw with the James PBLO, it can take tribes years to see any kind of justice. So sometimes when those systems fail, native people choose to take matters into their own hands. Which brings me back to the fight for 1492 landback lane. The Honosy struggle didn't begin with trenches and barricades. Before that summer, battles had been fought in the Canadian Parliament and Court system and through federal land claim processes. The honesty point back to the Haldderman proclamation signed in 1784 by the governor of Quebec that promised them nearly 950,000 acres. It was a sign of goodwill after the honied with the British during the American Revolution lost millions of acres in what's now New York State. But it wasn't long after the proclamation was made that European settlers began moving in on their promised territory, pushing natives out. Dr. Rick Monour, a Hundon historian, told reporters, ""We took it to the court system. We race it to every politician that would listen for the last 200 years or more, but no one ever does anything."" I feel you, Rick. So, with the systems failing them left and right, the Honjour had finally had enough. After the announcement of a massive new housing addition that would develop the last of the open land in the area, protesters calling themselves land offenders moved in and set up an encampment. At first, things were peaceful. There were traditional dances, songs, and food. But within a few weeks, the police raided the encampment and arrested several of the land offenders. In response, the defenders dug in, setting up a blockade and letting the government know they had no plans to leave willingly. The traditions remained, but now they existed alongside burning tire fires and graffitied buses. And it worked. Sort of. A year later, the land developers announced the cancellation of the planned housing complex. But as of 2024, over 1,400 days after the start of the protest, there had been no resolution between the nations and the government. The Huny were still fighting for their rights to the land more broadly. So the occupation continued with a half dozen members now living full-time on the property. That's commitment. As representatives from the occupation told the government, ""We will continue to cultivate orchards, sing our songs, and hold space here. We will be free on our land for however long it takes Canada to realize we are never going to leave and for generations after that."" This is just one example of landback activism. But across North America, advocates are working every day to undo centuries of injustice, broken treaties, and land theft, both in the courts and on the ground. So landback is a big idea. It's about getting native people back to the land, nursing the land back to health, and bringing back our understanding of land as essential to human life. This can mean long, hard-fought court cases, and it could also mean direct activism and protest, and it continues to this day. In our next episode, we're going to shift gears and talk about the ways that native culture has been appropriated in the media, and I will see you then.

the six nations, occupied an area of land in calonia, ontario. they dug trenches, erected concrete barriers, and even blocked a railroad and a highway. the nations were protesting a planned housing development on land they argued was stolen. so, they parked the bus, literally, and renamed the area 1492 lambag lane. but did it work? hi, i'm jay jim and welcome to crash course native american history.  music  landback. it shows up on t-shirts, billboards, flags, and street art across indian country. but what does it actually mean? is it a political movement, a philosophy, a form of protest? well, it's sort of all of the above. basically, landback describes any effort by native people to reclaim authority over stolen land and resources. it's a way of asserting tribal sovereignty that inherent right to self-governance. sometimes landback means suing the government to honor treaties. other times it means erecting a barricade to keep land developers out. but more on that story in a bit. the landback movement exists because a lot has happened to native land over the past few centuries. it was stolen in a number of ways. through the legal system, broken treaties, and often outright violence. if you want to know more, you can watch basically every episode in this series. in recent years, some private citizens and public figures have tried to call attention to this point through land acknowledgements, where a person or institution publicly states the land they're on was stolen from natives. and while a land acknowledgement can be a good-natured gesture, some natives say it's a hollow one, a way of saying sorry without really doing anything to make amends. in the words of aphabaskan writer cena crowe, indigenous communities need resources, not apologies. word, cena. but how landback actually works can vary pretty widely. like today, some of the land in question is privately owned, but much of it is managed by federal or state governments. in the privatelyowned cases, non-native owners have occasionally offered up the land voluntarily, either through a direct return of the land or by paying tribes a voluntary land tax, sometimes called settler rent. settler rent is a way for non-native people to transfer wealth back to the people whose land they occupy, just like anyone would pay rent to live on someone else's property. but while landback is about reclaiming land, organizers explain that the last thing they want to do is repeat the mistakes of colonization by kicking people out of their homes. like in 2015 when the pomo tribe bought back 700 acres on the california coast, the seller still lived on the land. so the tribe signed a contract that allowed him to keep living in his family home until his death, even though the pomo became the technical owners of that land. however, much of the land that native people seek to reclaim isn't owned by individuals. it's owned by federal or state governments, which means that landback often happens through the legal system. sometimes native nations are able to regain complete control over their land in this way. other times they agree to share control with the government. that's what happened in 2012 when the hez pblo tribe sued the united states over access to the bayas calera national preserve in what's now new mexico. the tribe argued it had never given up its right to the land there, even though it had been owned by the us since the government bought it from a private owner in 2000. it took 12 years, but in 2024, the two sides reached a settlement. the government agreed to set aside over 3,000 acres within the preserve for the pblo. and the pblo agreed to let the us park service maintain the land for public use. a win-win. the pblo could now return to their ancestral home. but the tribe got more than just land in the settlement. they want a chance to revitalize their culture. the governor of the himes pblo, peter matalina, said that the settlement was crucial to the survival of the trib's traditions. returning the land to the pblo gave them the freedom to practice songs and dances tied to that land, which had been part of their culture since well before the us existed. and that's the thing about lambach. it's not just about the land itself. it's also about reclaiming everything connected to the land, reviving tribal relationships and identity, making space for traditional indigenous world views. and this is especially relevant when it comes to the environment. as we've learned in previous episodes, natives often see the environment as both a gift and a responsibility. we take care of the land and the land takes care of us. so for many natives, widespread pollution and environmental degradation can be traced back to the same problem, colonization. when settlers separated the land from the native people who took care of it. let me give you an example. for centuries, native hawaiians had a diverse, self-sufficient food system. on the island of malayi, native made fish lagoons once fed about a million people. but after hawaii became a us territory in the late 19th century, millions of acres of land were stolen, and sellers turned much of it into sugarcane and pineapple plantations, destroying or abandoning the fish lagoons in the process. fast forward to today and you'll find over 80  of hawaii's food gets imported from elsewhere. and this lack of self-sufficiency in their food system is dangerous. because if an emergency affected the availability of imports, residents might not have enough to eat. so settles of native culture by changing the environment. they put everyone at risk. for many natives, this complex dilemma has one solution. landback. at its core, the lambback movement is about decolonization or undoing the ideas and systems imposed by colonization. like the ones that decided only sugarcane and pineapple should be grown at the expense of a sustainable food system. decolonization means understanding that the way things are isn't the way they have to be. just ask the native activists who are currently working to bring hawaii's native fish lagoons back. a nonprofit group called inan mimona or fertile land is leading a community effort to restore the land and teach a new generation of native hawaiians sustainable fishing techniques and traditional food practices. and when native folks get land back, it could have wide ranging, even global benefits. in fact, some experts say if we were to increase the forest land maintained by indigenous peoples globally by about 900 million acres in the next 25 years, it would be as impactful as bringing every truck on the road up to modern environmental admission standards. that's a win for all of us. unfortunately, one of the biggest obstacles the landback movement faces is a slow, tedious legal system. one that was never designed to give land back, only take it away. as we saw with the james pblo, it can take tribes years to see any kind of justice. so sometimes when those systems fail, native people choose to take matters into their own hands. which brings me back to the fight for 1492 landback lane. the honosy struggle didn't begin with trenches and barricades. before that summer, battles had been fought in the canadian parliament and court system and through federal land claim processes. the honesty point back to the haldderman proclamation signed in 1784 by the governor of quebec that promised them nearly 950,000 acres. it was a sign of goodwill after the honied with the british during the american revolution lost millions of acres in what's now new york state. but it wasn't long after the proclamation was made that european settlers began moving in on their promised territory, pushing natives out. dr. rick monour, a hundon historian, told reporters, ""we took it to the court system. we race it to every politician that would listen for the last 200 years or more, but no one ever does anything."" i feel you, rick. so, with the systems failing them left and right, the honjour had finally had enough. after the announcement of a massive new housing addition that would develop the last of the open land in the area, protesters calling themselves land offenders moved in and set up an encampment. at first, things were peaceful. there were traditional dances, songs, and food. but within a few weeks, the police raided the encampment and arrested several of the land offenders. in response, the defenders dug in, setting up a blockade and letting the government know they had no plans to leave willingly. the traditions remained, but now they existed alongside burning tire fires and graffitied buses. and it worked. sort of. a year later, the land developers announced the cancellation of the planned housing complex. but as of 2024, over 1,400 days after the start of the protest, there had been no resolution between the nations and the government. the huny were still fighting for their rights to the land more broadly. so the occupation continued with a half dozen members now living full-time on the property. that's commitment. as representatives from the occupation told the government, ""we will continue to cultivate orchards, sing our songs, and hold space here. we will be free on our land for however long it takes canada to realize we are never going to leave and for generations after that."" this is just one example of landback activism. but across north america, advocates are working every day to undo centuries of injustice, broken treaties, and land theft, both in the courts and on the ground. so landback is a big idea. it's about getting native people back to the land, nursing the land back to health, and bringing back our understanding of land as essential to human life. this can mean long, hard-fought court cases, and it could also mean direct activism and protest, and it continues to this day. in our next episode, we're going to shift gears and talk about the ways that native culture has been appropriated in the media, and i will see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course native american history, which was filmed at our studio

All the stuff we think of as literature isn't just art or entertainment. It's got a lot more to say. And I don't know about you, but I'm ready to hear the cheese. Hi, I'm Curly Velasquez, and this is Crash Course Latin American Literature. We've learned earlier in this series that the term Latin America wasn't in use until the 19th century around the time when the region's nations gained independence from Spain and Portugal. So when did Latin American literature start? I mean a lot of life and culture happened during the pre-colonial era before Christopher Columbus showed up completely uninvited by the way. For starters, indigenous communities like the Kichche or Mayan people of Guatemala had a rich tradition of oral literature. Stories were a super important part of understanding their own culture and history, including their origins. Through oral storytelling, they passed down stories of Kiche creation. Many involving two characters known as the hero twins, Kunapu and Spalangqu. Like in one story, the hero twins go to the underworld to avenge their father by playing a ball game awfully similar to soccer. Oh, I mean football. Anyway, together these stories are known as a pulvu. And if you're thinking, ""Curly, that oral literature looks a lot like a book."" You're not wrong. Sometime in the 1550s while under Spanish colonial rule, a kiche author or maybe a group of authors, not all writers work in tortured solitude used the Latin alphabet to record the popu as a book which transformed it from oral literature to, you know, literary literature. Then in the 18th century, a Dominican frier, no not that kind of Dominican, the one with the hair thing. Yes. Yes. named Francisco Gimenez translated the Pulbu from Kiche into Spanish, which is the version that we have now. It's one of only 14 surviving indigenous manuscripts from all of Latin America, which underscores the immense cultural loss that came with colonialism in this region. Just imagine what we're missing. But the Populu lives on, providing crucial insight about Latin American literature, both historically and now. So many of its themes appear in stories written centuries later, like the relationship between humans and nature, the importance of familial ancestors and animals acting as semi-agical spirit guides. We'll see these come up again and again in our series, too. Colonization in Latin America dragged on for over 300 years, but by the early 19th century, we start to see a major shift. Independence movements were springing up all across the continent. And as Latin Americans strive for political autonomy, literature reflected that. It gave voice to desires for independence and cultural self- definitionf. Take the 1823 poem Aloon La Poia, a location to poetry written by the Venezuelanborn poet Andres Beo while he was in exile in London. Beo addresses the poem like a letter written to divine poetry that lets us know he's talking about culture. and not sending a secret admirer note to yours truly. In the second stanza, Beao invites poetry to return to Latin America. It is time for you to leave Afitit Europe, no lover of your native rustic charms and fly to where Columbus's world opens its great scene before he rise. Now, if you're like, ""Excuse me, Columbus's world?"" That's what I thought, too. But what he's signaling with that phrase is not a return to the original indigenous Latin America. That world has been forever changed. So it has to become something new. But he's also not accepting a European view of the quote new world. He wants Latin Americans to shift their eyes to the great scene that is Latin America today. One independent from that stage five clinger European influence. As the poem goes on, Bealeo situates poetry as the soul of his people, using the genre as a standin for the whole region, seeking freedom and its own cultural identity. Beo was also a grimarian and a politician because even in the 1800s, poets needed side gigs. It's a tough life out here. He created a Spanish grammar that helped new nations make the language their own. And he held political positions in Venezuela, Colombia, and Chile as they established their own independent nation states. And I mean, when your poets are politicians and your politicians are poets, there's no separating literature from political history. But poetry wasn't the only kind of literature that popped off during this period of revolution. Essays, academic works, and letters played a huge role, too. Take Beo's good friend, Simon Bolivar. He was a politician, statesman, and a revolutionary leader. He's best known for helping the colonial territory Viseroy of New Granada win independence and establish the countries of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela. One of Bolivar's most famous literary works is Garta de Hamika, Jamaica letter written in 1815. While Bolivad was in exile in Jamaica, it expresses his hope and determination for a free Latin America. But Wolivad also expresses the unique challenges of forming new national identities after centuries of colonization. Writing, we are neither Indians nor Europeans. Yet we are a part of each. To be clear, he means indigenous folks, not people from India. Classic Colombian era stuff. So he's saying like, who are we? We no longer have the culture of indigenous peoples because we've been influenced by centuries of European colonization. But we haven't become European either. We're still our own thing. For the critic Roberto Gonzalez Echavaria, Bolivar's conundrum is the starting point of most modern Latin American literature. How do you balance a European mindset with regional history and culture? And how do you pin all of that down in a work of literature or in your own identity for that matter? Over the following centuries, as Latin American writers worked through these questions and discovered their own unique voices and cultural identities, people outside the region began to discover that Latin American secret sauce, too. And I'm not talking habanero. By the time the 1960s rolled around, the Latin American boom had begun. A literary movement that saw Latin American writers achieve unprecedented international success. The nova nolla new novel was the most popular literary form during this time and boom era novelists turned to centuries of Latin American history and literary tradition for inspiration all the way back to the football move and like the poetry of the independence movement boom novels tended to be pretty political. All those years of colonization and revolution inspired these writers as did more recent political movements like the Cuban revolution of the 1950s and the dictatorships in Argentina, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Paraguay. But this type of political and cultural upheaval wasn't limited to Latin America. In the 1960s, the world was changing everywhere. There were dozens of independence movements across Africa. the Berlin Wall was going up and the civil rights movement had begun in the US just to name a few examples. So these political themes resonated with international readers. But what really made the boom novel famous was the introduction of magical realism, a literary genre that blends magical elements with reality. What's so unique about magical realism is that in the world of the novel, those magical elements aren't perceived as being magical. like a levitating priest, casual, a flying carpet, whatever. A 5-year rainstorm, no biggie. All extraordinary moments presented as ordinary. And no, I didn't just make up those examples myself. I'm good, but I'm not that good. The credits due to Gabrielle Garcia Marquez, born in Colombia on March 6th, 1927. Garcia Marquez authored more than 24 books including his 1967 masterpiece dea 100 years of solitude which sounds like a dream. Leave me with a good book and a snack and I'm there. Oh. Oh my god. How'd you know? Let's get into the curly notes. Set in the fictional town of Makondo, 100 Years of Solitude tells the story of the Wendy family over the course of seven generations. That's a lot of abas. And the setting is so important. We see that in the beginning, Mount Mondo is isolated from the outside world. The village is made of just 20 adobe houses along a river lined with stones that look like prehistoric eggs. Garcia Marquez writes, ""The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them, it was necessary to point. Not at me, rude. But over time, new technologies, political unrest, and foreign businesses start reshaping the village. Many of them real historical events, like Colombia's war of a thousand days. By blending myth and reality, Garcia Marquez uses Mondo as a standin for all of Latin America, creating an intimate setting to discuss a whole region's complicated politics. Beyond Makondo, what's most memorable for many of us is Garcia Marquez's use of magical realism, including a rain of yellow flowers after the family's patriarch dies. They fell on the town all through the night in a silent storm, and they covered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered the animals who slept outdoors. So many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion and they had to clear them away with shovels and rakes so the funeral procession could pass by. This scene is so beloved that when Garcia Marquez passed away in 2014, people paid homage to him with memorials filled with yellow flower petals. Of course, Garcia Marquez is just one master of magical realism. Can we save that for later? Thank you so much. Boom writers like Julio Gartasar, Elan Agaro, Carlos Fuentes, Maria Louisa Bombal, and Mario Vargas Yossa have also woven fantastical threads into realistic stories, a tradition that traces all the way back to pre-colonial times. Now, for the global literary community, magical realism came to overdefine Latin American literature, reducing its diversity to just one thing. This is why we can't have nice things global literary community, but we'll talk more about that in a later episode. Our history is a part of us. It informs everything that we do, think, and create. And the same goes for the literature of Latin America. The region has a long and complex history littered with political strife and the struggle for identity, but also regional pride and football. That history is reflected in the novels, poems, letters, and essays of the people who helped to shape it. Next time we're heading to La Hungla, the jungle to explore what nature can teach us about humanity. See you then.

let's get into the curly notes. set in the fictional town of makondo, 100 years of solitude tells the story of the wendy family over the course of seven generations. that's a lot of abas. and the setting is so important. we see that in the beginning, mount mondo is isolated from the outside world. the village is made of just 20 adobe houses along a river lined with stones that look like prehistoric eggs. garcia marquez writes, ""the world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them, it was necessary to point. not at me, rude. but over time, new technologies, political unrest, and foreign businesses start reshaping the village. many of them real historical events, like colombia's war of a thousand days. by blending myth and reality, garcia marquez uses mondo as a standin for all of latin america, creating an intimate setting to discuss a whole region's complicated politics. beyond makondo, what's most memorable for many of us is garcia marquez's use of magical realism, including a rain of yellow flowers after the family's patriarch dies. they fell on the town all through the night in a silent storm, and they covered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered the animals who slept outdoors. so many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion and they had to clear them away with shovels and rakes so the funeral procession could pass by. this scene is so beloved that when garcia marquez passed away in 2014, people paid homage to him with memorials filled with yellow flower petals. of course, garcia marquez is just one master of magical realism. can we save that for later? thank you so much. boom writers like julio gartasar, elan agaro, carlos fuentes, maria louisa bombal, and mario vargas yossa have also woven fantastical threads into realistic stories, a tradition that traces all the way back to pre-colonial times. now, for the global literary community, magical realism came to overdefine latin american literature, reducing its diversity to just one thing. this is why we can't have nice things global literary community, but we'll talk more about that in a later episode. our history is a part of us. it informs everything that we do, think, and create. and the same goes for the literature of latin america. the region has a long and complex history littered with political strife and the struggle for identity, but also regional pride and football. that history is reflected in the novels, poems, letters, and essays of the people who helped to shape it. next time we're heading to la hungla, the jungle to explore what nature can teach us about humanity. see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course latin american literature, which was filmed at the carlos hernandez studio in indianapolis and was made with the help of all these storytellers. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone forever, you can join our community on patreon. oh, and if you're interested in learning about some of the topics covered in this episode, we pulled together a playlist you can dig into.",11108,1865

",US,16800000,1661,2025-11-04,2025,607,10.116666666666667,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9Xt3cl99LM,"How do you get a new generation of kids excited about language? For the Nubio people, one answer is a video game. In 2014, the Cook Inlet Tribal Council helped create Kima Initi or Never Alone. Players take on the role of a young Inupia girl named Nuna as she solves puzzles with her Arctic Fox and the whole game is narrated in Inupia. But why don't these kids already know the language of their ancestors? I'm Shay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] Language is the foundation of culture and for native folks it's how we preserve our oral histories, maintain our laws, pass down knowledge of the natural world and so much more. As Da Elder Paul Dain said, our language and culture is the window through which we see the world. To lose it is to lose part of ourselves. But sadly, fluency rates for Native American languages have been declining for hundreds of years. Today, many of those languages are in danger of disappearing altogether. Some scholars predict that over 90% of all Native American languages could disappear by 2050 with no fluent speakers left to carry them forward. We're going to talk a lot more about why this is happening and what's being done to prevent it a little bit later. But things haven't always been this dire depending on which scholars you ask. Prior to the 15th century, there were anywhere between 300 to 2,000 distinct native languages spoken across the continent. Imagine it. Just a few hundred years ago, right here in what's now Indianapolis, you could have heard dozens of different indigenous languages. It might have been hard to get directions, though. We can learn a lot about tribal cultures from their languages. Not just from what's said out loud, but also from what's between the lines. Like, think about this. Our language reveals something about things we value. Maybe that's why in English everything's such a big hit or a home run. Unless, of course, you drop the ball. Oh, well, you win some, you lose some. We get it. You like sports. Native languages do this, too. The tribe's worldview is often baked into the language itself. Many languages have certain types of nouns and verbs for gender that show its importance in the culture's worldview. Like in Anesnab Moen spoken by the Ojiway Odawa and Padawatami peoples, there are special classes for nouns and verbs for both living and non-living objects which underscores the cultural idea of kinship or family relations among people, animals, and non-living elements. Podawatami writer and botnist Robin Wall Kimmeer breaks it down like this. Of an inanimate being like a table, we say what is it? And we answer dopini. table it is. But of an apple we must say who is that being and reply mashim mean Yahweh apple that being is? Or in my tribe the Navajo or D we use the word to refer to a sense of harmony in different situations. Like if someone asks you or how are you you might respond meaning it's good. But we also use it when concluding a prayer. we say four times in a row to mean all is at peace again. So even though there's no direct English translation for hjo, you can still get the idea that it represents a state of balance and harmony. The point is to understand cultural ideas, it helps to understand the languages they were originally communicated through. Otherwise, things get lost in translation. And not just languages, but ideas and cultures. And for nearly all native speakers in the US, the window to save them is closing. So what happened? Why are native languages in danger? Well, as with so many other aspects of Native American life, these languages were drastically altered with the arrival of European colonizers in the 15th century. For hundreds of years, those colonists and later the US government committed what's called linguisticide, the deliberate killing of language as part of a broader effort to erase native culture. The attempt to absorb a minority culture into the dominant culture is called assimilation. But there was one assimilation policy in particular that had an outsized impact on native languages. Federal Indian boarding schools. Now, just a heads up, what I'm about to cover is difficult to hear, so please take care as you watch on. Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of native childrens were forcefully separated from their parents and enrolled into boarding schools modeled after a prisoner of war camps. When the students arrived, administrators took their clothes, cut their hair, and bathe them in kerosene to cleanse them and prevent the spread of illness and lice. The children were given English names and forbidden from speaking their native languages. If a student spoke just a single word of Indian, they were punished, which could include whippings, solitary confinement, starvation, and even withholding medical treatment. Bill Wright, a Pawan Indian elder, spoke out about the abuse he and other native children suffered in these schools. In an interview with NPR, Rice said that he lost his culture, his language, and even his name, telling reporters, quote, ""I remember coming home and my grandma asked me to talk Indian to her, and I said, ""Grandma, I don't understand you."" And when she called him by his Indian name, Tarum, he told her his name was Billy. And if it feels like these schools are a part of a long ago past, Wright passed away in 2021. In fact, there are still boarding school survivors alive today fighting for recognition, justice, and healing. By 1900, 20,000 Indian children were in boarding schools. That number jumped up to more than 60,000 just 25 years later. And by 1926, nearly 83% of Indian school age children were attending boarding schools. It wasn't until 1972 when Congress passed the Indian Education Act, thanks in part to pressure from native groups, that control of the schools passed to tribal authorities. But by then, the damage had been done. A 2024 federal report found that at least 973 children died at these schools. while acknowledging that the true total is likely much higher. And many thousands of children left these schools having lost all connection to their traditional languages. Those who did remember them now associate those languages with deep lasting trauma. Many former students chose not to pass their language on to their children and grandchildren in order to spare them from that same pain. This generational loss has rippled across communities. In places like Alaska, language loss has been linked to higher rates of poverty, substance abuse, and suicide. In 2018, the governor of Alaska declared a linguistics emergency in the state, recognizing the loss and potential extinction of the official 20 Alaskan native languages, which brings me back to the new pat and their attempt to revive their language. Unlike other video games, Never Alone doesn't reward players with trophies or points, but rather traditional stories from Alaskan native culture. At the same time, important aspects of that culture are built into the gameplay, like the hero Nuna often relies on spirits to help guide her on her journey. Since its release, a classroom guide has been created and distributed along with copies of the game to every school district in Alaska. Elsewhere, native folks are incorporating their languages into music. Like Wade Fernandez, a singer songwriter from the Monomony nation, his song Sua Mia, or we are blessed combines contemporary melodies with his traditional Monomin language. [Music] Plus, it's a total banger. In places like Hawaii and Arizona, native language immersion schools encourage students to wear traditional clothing, speak their languages, and engage with their cultures. A complete 180 from the boarding school era. Studies have shown that native students in immersion schools have better test scores, stronger cultural connections, and higher rates of graduation compared to native students in public schools. The programs have been so successful in Hawaii that language programs have expanded to the college level. Students there can now attend university courses taught entirely in Native Hawaiian. And it's having a big impact. In the early 1980s, fewer than 50 people below the age of 18 could speak fluent Native Hawaiian. Thanks to immersion schools and revisation efforts, over 18,000 people now speak Hawaiian statewide. And a language that students were once punished for speaking is now protected by law. These efforts are even working their way into broader culture. Like the original Star Wars film was dubbed in Navajo in 2012. And in 2022, the movie Prey became the first film to fully be dubbed in the Comanche language. Can every movie be like this? Dorothy Labaueti Shakuan elder once said, quote, ""Losing the language means losing the culture. We need to know who we are because it makes a difference in who our children are."" Before Europeans arrived, North America was full of diverse languages that carried not just meaning, but history, culture, and entire ways of knowing. Thankfully, revitalization efforts are making headway today to preserve what might have otherwise been lost forever. Next time, we'll explore the landback movement, and I will see you then.

So, we're talking about anywhere from 20 to 52 countries and territories where hundreds of languages are spoken across millions of square miles. As I scrolled through these debates in a few scholarly toms and read it, I couldn't help but wonder why lump so many distinct countries into one identity. What makes a Latin American Latin American? Hi, I'm Kurly Velasquez and this is Crash Course Latin American literature. Do we have to agree on what Latin America is before talking about Latin American literature? How much time do you have? It turns out the Latin American label is surprisingly new. Some historians say the term began with the French in the 1830s. In an attempt to seize power over Mexico, Napoleon the third, no, not not that Napoleon, the one with the bigote. Yes. Yes. wanted to emphasize that both France and Mexico shared Latin roots in their languages, hence Latin America. This was an example of imperialism where one country takes power over another and it's a critical part of Latin American history. But so is resistance to imperialism. Others credit the name Latin America to Chilean politician Francisco Vilvao who called for dozens of countries to unite under this shared identity and the fight against global imperial powers. Today there's disagreement about why the term has stuck around too. Is Latin America still in use because outsiders flatten other cultures into falsely uniform identities? Or because people from the region feel a shared sense of community despite national differences? In this series, we'll use Latin America to mean countries with the shared history of colonization by Spain and Portugal, followed by independence. But to get a bigger picture, we'll also explore indigenous literature and Latin American authors in the US who write in English. One thing you'll learn about me is I don't do anything small. And all these questions about what unites and divides a region, about where its boundaries fall, about who we are in relationship to each other, they're not simply hurdles we have to clear. They're some of the central questions at the heart of so much of Latin American literature. Now, because Latin Americans are diverse, it's challenging to choose one label to describe us. Like in the US, you may hear the terms Latino or Latina to refer to immigrants from Latin America and their descendants or genderneutral alternatives like Latinex or Latina. You guys, it is one letter change. We will all survive. I promise. Meanwhile, the term Hispanic refers to people of Spanish-sp speakaking descent or origin. So, someone from Spain would be Hispanic but not Latino. And a Portuguese-speaking Brazilian might consider themselves Latino but not Hispanic. And there are a lot of other community specific terms out there like cho for people of Mexican descent living in the US or Afro Latino for those in Latin America with African ancestry or even New Rican for Puerto Ricans living in New York. So yeah, Latin America includes lots of different communities across lots of different countries and languages, which means in literature we find lots of different answers to the question, who are we? Some Latin American authors like Mexican Canadian writer Sylvia Moreno Garcia write mostly in English. Others write both in Spanish and English. and some flip between languages even within the same text like Los Rios Profundos deep rivers by Jose Maria Argedas uses both Spanish and the indigenous language Ketwa. Sometimes you'll find Spanglish a mixture of Spanish and English like in Sandra Cisneros's The House on Mango Street. You'll also find Portuno, a blend of Portuguese and Spanish like in Fabian Seo's novel No, Nights in the North. And language plays a big role in the international availability of Latin American literature too. Well, language, power, and you know, capitalism. Like, US publishers have been more interested in books from Argentina and Mexico for at least the last decade. So, these are the books that tend to get translated into English, and that influences what can make its way into English language classes and crash courses. In this series, we'll span diverse genres and take a broad view of what literature means or literature if you're Oprah. We'll cover the usual suspects, poetry, novels, and short stories, but also dive into historical accounts, political essays, and other texts. Do my ex's text messages count too or not so much? Oh, you're saying no. Okay. often will encounter authors with ties to multiple countries like Gladis Leeto was born in Ukraine but spent much of her life in Brazil and the Cuban writer Jose Marti wrote for an Argentine newspaper while in exile in New York. So, it's no surprise that Latin American literature often wrestles with big questions about identity, like what's our relationship to Europe and the rest of the world for that matter after being colonized and gaining independence? And what's our relationship to our indigenous ancestors and our African ancestors, too? Given the blend of indigenous, African, and European influences, who even are we? Anyone? Anyone? Okay, how about we hash this out with Mexican writer Octavio Bas. Here are the curly notes on P's 1950 essay loss de la Maline the sons of Maline. Maline wasn't your average senora. She was a multilingual indigenous woman who after being enslaved and handed over to the Spanish as a teenager interpreted for Ednan Cortez during his conquest of Dino Titlan in 1521. She and Cortez also had a son who's seen as one of the first mystisos, meaning people of mixed indigenous and Spanish ancestry, which describes most of Mexico's population today. Bas writes that Maline is often remembered as a traitor who gave herself voluntarily to the concistador and that the Mexican people have not forgiven La Maline for her betrayal. He points out that the word Malineista became a popular insult to quote denounce all those who have been corrupted by foreign influences. Am I tripping or is Cortez the real villain here? Bas argues that the reason Mexicans condemn Malinee is to try to distance themselves from a painful part of their past and transcended. The Mexican does not want to be either an Indian or a Spaniard, nor does he want to be descended from them. He denies them and he does not affirm himself as a mixture but rather as an abstraction. His beginnings are in his own self. I'm going to need some gapito to process this one. [Music] Much better. When your national identity is a mix of cultures and has been shaped by violent colonization, how do you begin to answer a question like who are we? How far back should we go for answers? and how close to home should we stay? Another Mexican writer, Carlos Fuentes, explores those questions in his 1975 novel, Deer Nostra. Rather than analyze a single historical figure like Maline, Fuentes prowls for answers across history, zooming between ancient Rome, pre-colonial Mexico, 16th century Spain, and 1999 Paris. But Fuentes doesn't stop there. He links Spain's colonization of the Americas to a much bigger story. A New York Times review described Terran Nostra as a panoramic espano American creation myth and the scholar Lucille Kerr says that it explores Mexican identity in terms of universal myth and history. In the world of Theronostra, the mystery of Mexican identity is the same mystery of civilization on which civilization itself is founded. Meaning like we're all products of violent histories of borders that shifted over time. All of civilization is a story of different peoples clashing and melding and becoming something new. In this way, the Latin American story or stories really shed light on all of our stories. Much of the Anostra focuses on a fictionalized account of the real life Spanish king Felipe II, who was a true Nepo baby. He inherited his entire kingdom from his dad. Must be nice. All I got from my dad was a used Honda. Filipe obsessively constructed a massive palace/moselum called the escoreal and Fuentes portrays it in a real the emperor has no clothes kind of way. Even though Spain colonized and held power in the Americas for centuries, Filipe's single-minded focus on what amounts to an extremely elaborate coffin reflects the emptiness of the whole colonial project as based on death on Nada. And Fuentes wasn't the only writer to explore Latin American identity by thinking globally. Before him in Argentina, Jorge Luis Boures wrestled with these issues in his work. He was of Spanish, Portuguese, and English descent, educated in Switzerland, and traveled off into Europe. His whole life and work was at the crossroads of these identity intersections. And in his 1951 essay, El escentino tradition, the Argentine writer and tradition, Boures encourages others to work at these crossroads, too. He resists the idea that to be an Argentine writer means only dabbling in your own backyard. We must believe that the universe is our birthright and try out every subject. Besus is capturing a tension between the local and the global that can be found in a lot of Latin American literature in communities living with the legacy of colonization. You can't start asking a question like who are we without searching the world for answers. So what do you do with that? The Brazilian writer Oswald Deandra suggests cannibalism, cultural cannibalism that is. He does it himself in his 1928 essay manifesto anthropoago. cannibalist manifesto with this line. Dupy or not dupee? That is the question. Sound familiar? He's reappropriating Shakespeare's famous line from Hamlet using the similar sounding name of an indigenous people in Brazil. Like why not devour and Brazilify one of the most famous lines in English literature? Andraj calls for Brazilians to do the same. Take in the influences, blend them up, and pour them out as something totally new. Oh, thank you. It's my postc colonial protein smoothie. I think it needs some work. In a vastly diverse region, you're not going to find one single answer to the question, who are we? Latin American literature is produced across many different communities in many different languages from a blend of influences. And when Latin American writers explore identity, they're often navigating the tension between influences from their own neighborhood and the other side of the world. To which I say, no loss. Why not both? Next time we'll talk about how stories, history, and politics collide. See you then.

Can tribal governments actually do that? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] Tribal governments are the governing bodies of federally recognized tribes, each separate and distinct in its own right. And yeah, they can keep people from entering their lands, even if they happen to be a state governor. This is just one example of how tribal governments can sometimes conflict with federal and state ones. But bans aren't the only way they exercise their power. Far from it. Today, we're going to talk about how tribal governments operate and the delicate tight ropes they walk. But before we dive into the nitty-gritty politics of it all, let's start with some basics. Native nations have always had an inherent right to self-govern known as sovereignty, which you can learn a lot more about in episode two. And because of that sovereignty, tribal governments have a totally unique relationship to the US governments where they're subject to certain federal laws, yet make their own laws on their own land. This creates a push and pull that pops up all the time. like it came up around plans to build a pipeline near the Standing Rock Stew reservation in 2016 and it comes up fairly often around casinos built on Indian territory. The way these issues are negotiated shows us how the expression of sovereignty by tribal governments changes over time. We'll get more into each of these examples in a moment, but first there's another even broader kind of conflict, a conflict of values about how government should even work in the first place. Let's turn back the clock to 1934 when the New Deal reigned supreme and a stamp only cost three cents. This was just a few years after the US government had formally acknowledged the awful situation they'd put native nations in. The average tribal member lived in poverty. Generations of native kids had been ripped from their families and sent to abusive boarding schools. And tribes had lost 90 million acres of land in just 50 years as a direct result of federal policies. Yikes. So, in an attempt to fix all that damage, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, aka the IRA. The goal was to reaffirm the government's support of native sovereignty. Love that for us. But there's a catch. Policy makers didn't think traditional native governments were fit for the demands of modern life. Traditionally, some tribal governments ruled by consensus, where leaders would hold community discussions about everyone's concerns and move towards a solution that blended all of their perspectives. Everybody heard each other out and cooperated to find a compromise. This was and is a hugely important value underlying how many tribal governments work. But the US wanted tribal governments to reflect their own and withheld IRA funding until tribes gave themselves a makeover. Specifically, the federal government wanted them to move to a system of majority rule where the group chooses the option that gets the most votes regardless of other people's concerns. A lot of tribes weren't thrilled about giving up their consensus governments. In fact, 77 of them voted to reject the plan, but 181 native nations did reorganize under the IRA. And today, there are two main ways those tribal governments are set up. with a modern structure or hybrid structure. Let's start with the modern structure. Typically, this means having an organizing document like a constitution approved by the secretary of the interior. Usually, but not always, there's an elected tribal council and tribal chairperson, which operate as legislative and executive branches, respectively. Together, they can negotiate on the trib's behalf with federal, state, and local governments. And many, but not all, have their own court systems and their own tribal police. You can see how this reflects the US government with its three separate branches creating checks and balances. Members of the council and the chairperson are elected democratically by tribal members, the same as a congressperson or the president would be. Meanwhile, tribal laws are enacted by a majority vote in the council, similar to Congress, and enforced by tribal courts, similar to the Supreme Court. Yep. Yep. looks like a modern American government. Then there's the hybrid structure which blends older and newer forms of tribal governments together. This mixture can look different from tribe to tribe. For example, it can involve making decisions both through elected officials and through traditionally selected leaders or it can involve incorporating consensus in some parts of governance but majority rule in others. Take the prot tribe. They were among the 77 that initially rejected the IRA. And though they did eventually establish executive, legislative, and judicial branches, they've also held on to traditional values of consensus through a general council that includes every adult member of the tribe. Anybody who's on the council can independently propose legislation. And for an initiative to pass, at least twothirds of the council needs to be on board with it. So, we've got a handle on the various ways tribal governments operate. But what does this look like in practice? What do tribal governments actually do? First and foremost, they govern their own citizens within their territories. They alone call the shots on what it takes to be one of those citizens. They control how much of their land gets used. They oversee their own schools, utilities, roads, and communication networks. And much like a local or state government, tribes can issue business licenses and collect sales tax within their borders. But at the same time, the federal government can restrict tribal government's authority, drastically affecting native people's lives. We natives are currently in our selfdetermination era. Basically, it means the US government has agreed to use its authority mostly to defend tribal sovereignty and help repair the damage of centuries past. And that means tribes have more direct involvement in the public services that are maintained and delivered in Indian country. But things aren't perfect. and tribal agencies often have to navigate a maze of bureaucracy to get the support that they need. We're talking miles of red tape. For example, the National Tribal Broadband Grant helps link reservations to high-speed internet, which is a big deal. It makes it possible for tribal citizens to do distance learning, work remotely, have telealth appointments, or I don't know, watch Crash Course. Just a thought. But funding sources like this are spread across seven different federal agencies. So it could be hard for tribal governments to even know they exist, much less identify the funding they qualify for. And when federal agencies do make policies that affect tribes, they're supposed to consult with tribal governments first. They're supposed to get input from the tribal officials before imposing rules and compensate tribal governments if it'll be costly to comply with them. That's what's supposed to happen. But this is more of an ideal than a description of how things always go. Take what happened in 2016 with the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The corporation building the pipeline planned for it to cross beneath Lake Aah close enough to contaminate the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sue if an oil leak happened. The US Army Corps of Engineers had approved the plan without consulting the tribe. Understandably, the Standing Rock Sue weren't happy about this, so the tribe sued and requested that all the construction stop at once. The Sue sued, but construction continued and the tribe lost in court. The federal government did ask the company building the pipeline to pretty please of their own choosing, leave a buffer of 20 m around Lake Oah, but the company didn't listen. The pipeline was built and continues to operate today, but the fight isn't over. The Standing Rock Sue have continued to call for the pipeline to be removed and the governments and companies alike are discovering that tribal governments are a force to be reckoned with. Just ask Christy Gnome. And it's not just Standing Rock. Many other tribal governments are asserting their sovereignty these days and resisting efforts to restrict it when necessary. After all, sovereignty is like a muscle. The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets. For example, some tribes operate casinos or gaming operations on their land as a way of raising funds to run their governments, which is allowed under federal law. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act says tribes can enter into gaming compacts with states. And if any state law conflicts with federal law, the federal law is supposed to apply. Paper beats rock. But in 2019, the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitz, tried to block tribes from renewing their gaming compacts automatically, which arguably could have ended those compacts altogether. Multiple tribes sued, arguing that this move violated federal law, and the federal courts agreed because again, paper beats rock. But asserting tribal sovereignty is rarely that simple. And as we saw with the Dakota Access Pipeline, at times tribes have had to challenge corporations and the federal government, fighting a war on multiple fronts. That's just a small slice of what makes running a modern tribal government such a unique challenge. Each one faces very different problems than it did five centuries ago. So they've had to adapt and change while retaining aspects of their identity as sovereign independent nations. After all, we're talking about nations within a larger nation. things are bound to be complex. In our next episode, we're going to talk about the ways that Native nations are working to preserve their traditional languages and I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-10-14,2025,822,13.7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj8EjBQJD84,"Native women have always had a sacred and powerful role in our communities. Not only as aunties, mamas and grandmas, although those are some very important jobs, too, but also as holy women, healers, leaders, and across cultures and languages. Native oral traditions are brimming with some pretty divine female figures, protectors of land and sea, creation and destruction, life and death. Hi, I'm Lily Gladstone and this is Crash Course Native American History. [Music] Well, before Europeans arrived in what is now North America, native beliefs around gender were and honestly still are pretty diverse. In fact, many Native American tribes are matriarchal, meaning women hold significant power in our communities, including as the uh primary decision makers. Matriarchal tribes then and now tend to value ideas such as equality, consensus finding, giftgiving, and peace building. For example, with Navajo or D, mothers and grandmothers serve as the matriarchs or the heads of individual clans. While men usually are leading intertribal meetings and making decisions about war, women have the final say when it comes to clan disputes. They control their own land, their own livestock, their own crafts, and any money that they earn, they keep. Da are also matrinal, meaning that family heritage is passed through the mother's line. This equality can be found in Da spirituality too. Both men and women are allowed to become medicine people, traditional healers who perform ceremonies for the sick. It's said that Ashta Nadle or changing woman explained it to the son, the father of her children, like this. You are of sky, I am of earth. Remember, as different as we are, you and I, we are of one spirit. We are of equal worth. And back in the day, while Da women didn't join raids or go to war, women in other tribes did. Mine included. Her name was running eagle Petan. Among a lot of native nations, women would often lead war parties and participate in battles. How about Buffalo Cathro woman of the northern Cheyenne in what is now Montana? In the late 1800s, she and her family were camping near a creek when a group of white soldiers attacked. When her brother fell in the fight, she rode into battle and rescued him. About a week later, with her Colt 45, Buffalo Calfro woman would fight in the battle of the Little Bigghorn. And though we don't know for sure, there are plenty of stories from several tribal nations that claim it was a woman who dealt Kuster the final blow. Other Native women took on the roles of leaders and diplomats in times of conflict. In fact, one of the strongest Native American confederacies, the Hodnosi, was co-founded by a native woman named Chukon Sensei. Let me tell you her story. Oh. Way back before European arrival, there were five waring nations. The Kauga, the Mohawk, Onida, Onendaga, and Saka. Jon sensei didn't want any part of that war. But she lived along a war road, one that warriors from every nation traveled. So instead of shutting the door and turning them away, she offered shelter and food to anyone who came through. She even helped resolve arguments between members of different nations. Mhm. Meanwhile, a man named Peacemaker was looking to end the war and unify the five nations, which makes sense, name like that. H. After hearing about Jacon Sensei, peacemakers set out to see her kindness for himself. He told her about his vision for a unified nation, describing a long house with a representative from each nation in their own seat. Because she was neutral and well-liked, peacemaker asked Jon Sensei to assist him in establishing a system of governance based on peace. He gave her the name Mother of Nations, and she would go on to be instrumental in the formation of the Hodnosi Confederacy. Thanks in part to Jakon Sensei, Hodnosi Law recognizes the equal responsibilities of women and men in all manners, which still guides their practices today. That's right. in that good way. And that's the story of Jacon Sensei. Mhm. All these women are definitely inspiring, but not every Native American tribe has treated women and men as equals, which has become something of a sticky misconception. And while it is flattering, it's also flattening because it smooths out the diversity among Native American cultures. While we're all pretty awesome, we're also hundreds of different tribes with different cultures and values. Like not all tribes are matriarchal. Some divided labor strictly along gender lines and others men held most of the wealth and power. And to add a further twist, native people didn't always think about gender in the same way as Europeans. In Da culture, for example, the Nadle embrace both masculine and feminine energies, and the Da view them as sacred. And Native Hawaiians have historically recognized people who identify as mahu, a word that goes beyond gender and serves as a bridge between male and female. The point is, while plenty of native cultures had some equality between men and women, there was also no single way of thinking about gender. But the onset of European colonization disrupted gender roles as it did so many other things. So many Europeans didn't vibe with the way women held power in many native societies. As Lagona PBlo scholar Polygon Allen put it, the colonizers saw and rightly that as long as women held unquestioned power of such magnitude, attempts at a total conquest of the continents were bound to fail. Northern Cheyenne have a saying, ""A nation is not defeated until the hearts of its women are on the ground."" So colonizers got to work dismantling that power. They stripped native women of the roles and rights they had for centuries. At times, this looked like elevating men to positions of power, but more often than not, it came in the form of violence toward native women. Now, we're about to get into some dark history. This is heavy stuff, and it's important to take care. Violence against native women wasn't a passive byproduct of colonization. It was targeted and strategic. Women were often singled out because of their ability to bear children, the very thing that was seen as sacred by many tribes. By killing native women, colonizers could destabilize native populations, which was part of a broader effort to destroy and replace native people with European settlers. That's a core part of settler colonialism, which you can learn more about in episode one. This violence had disastrous and widespread consequences. Thousands of native women were abused and killed, and tribal culture was permanently altered for many native nations like the Chalkaw, whose matrineal system of heritage was marginalized by colonial society. Unfortunately, this type of violence continued to haunt the United States for centuries. It still does. For example, in the 1970s, the federal government authorized the secret sterilization of thousands of native women, at least 36 of whom were under the age of 21. One study found that between 1973 and 1976, 1 in4 American Indian women were sterilized without their consent. Some scholars have described violence against Native women as rare in Native American societies before the arrival of Europeans, though today it's a very different story. Native American women face some of the highest rates of violence in the nation, and nearly 96% of it is committed by non-natives. The CDC's data from 2018 to 2023 shows that the third leading cause of death for native women ages 15 to 24 was homicide. And for ages 25 to 44, it's in the top 10. Those numbers likely underrepresent the actual scale of violence. A 2022 report by Amnesty International found that most law enforcement agencies either don't record native women's ethnicity, mislabel them as Hispanic, or lump them into a catch-all category of other. This has caused an untold number of native women's stories to effectively disappear. To make matters worse, crimes in Indian country are difficult to bring to justice because in many cases, Native American law enforcement isn't able to prosecute non-native criminals. We get more into this and other complications of federal Indian law in episode 16. Thankfully, Native Activism is making some headway on this front. The missing and murdered indigenous women movement or MMIW is spreading awareness and advocating for policy change to address the violence against indigenous women, indigenous fems, indigenous twospirit and indigenous girls. And it's making an impact. In 2020, thanks in part to this activism, the not invisible act was signed into law. It created a federal commission to develop methods for identifying, reporting, and responding to instances of missing persons, murder, and human trafficking on Indian lands and of Indians. The act itself was authored by then representative Deb Holland, a member of the Lagona Pueblo Nation and the first native woman to serve as US Secretary of the Interior. Hey, the first Indian head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. How revolutionary. Thank you, Deb. Thank you, Deb. And of course, activism and leadership by Native American women is nothing new and extends beyond the scope of MMIW alone. Consider Ladonna Harris, a Comanche activist who in the 1960s spearheaded Oklahoma's for Indian opportunity, the very first intertribal coalition in the state. This was a big deal in an era when people from many different native nations had begun coming together in new and powerful ways to advocate for improved conditions. Harris went on to serve on Lynden B. Johnson's National Council on Indian Opportunity and later to found Americans for Indian Opportunity, a much broader version of the work she'd begun in Oklahoma. And let's hear it for Eloise Cobell, also known as Yellowbird Woman. She was a tribal elder, activist, banker, and a member of the Black Feetat Nation who grew up hearing stories about tribal members not getting payments they were owed for use of their land held in trust by the federal government. Years later, when she became treasurer of the Black Feet Nation, she witnessed evidence of it herself. She found records of oil being extracted from Black Feet land, but no record of any payments. So, in 1996, Coobel led the charge in holding the government accountable. She brought a class action lawsuit against the United States for mismanaging trust funds of over 500,000 Native Americans. It was a long fight, but in 2010, Coobel versus Salazar culminated in a $3.4 billion settlement that went toward getting tribal members the payments they were owed, restoring fractioned land to tribal governments, and starting a scholarship fund. Rest in peace, Eloise. And plenty of non-native women have been inspired by the work of native women, including many early American feminists. Take Matilda Jocelyn Gage, a 19th century leader in the women's suffrage movement. She grew up in New York State where the Hodnosone Confederacy was based. You know, the one our girl Jacconson say helped establish. As she and others became increasingly frustrated by resistance to the women's movement, they found inspiration in their indigenous neighbors. Gage once wrote of the Hodnosone Confederacy, ""Never was justice more perfect. Never was civilization higher."" The point is, native women impact more than just native history. We impact all history. Despite centuries of oppression and violence, we're still here imparting wisdom, advocating for change, exercising leadership, and lifting up native voices, which is as important today as it ever was. In our next episode, we're going to take a look at the way modern tribal governments operate. Good luck, Chay. Thanks, Lily. I want to be like her when I grow up.

[Music]",a history of indigenous women with lily gladstone  ep 19 of crash course native american history,"native women have always had a sacred and powerful role in our communities. not only as aunties, mamas and grandmas, although those are some very important jobs, too, but also as holy women, healers, leaders, and across cultures and languages. native oral traditions are brimming with some pretty divine female figures, protectors of land and sea, creation and destruction, life and death. hi, i'm lily gladstone and this is crash course native american history.  music  well, before europeans arrived in what is now north america, native beliefs around gender were and honestly still are pretty diverse. in fact, many native american tribes are matriarchal, meaning women hold significant power in our communities, including as the uh primary decision makers. matriarchal tribes then and now tend to value ideas such as equality, consensus finding, giftgiving, and peace building. for example, with navajo or d, mothers and grandmothers serve as the matriarchs or the heads of individual clans. while men usually are leading intertribal meetings and making decisions about war, women have the final say when it comes to clan disputes. they control their own land, their own livestock, their own crafts, and any money that they earn, they keep. da are also matrinal, meaning that family heritage is passed through the mother's line. this equality can be found in da spirituality too. both men and women are allowed to become medicine people, traditional healers who perform ceremonies for the sick. it's said that ashta nadle or changing woman explained it to the son, the father of her children, like this. you are of sky, i am of earth. remember, as different as we are, you and i, we are of one spirit. we are of equal worth. and back in the day, while da women didn't join raids or go to war, women in other tribes did. mine included. her name was running eagle petan. among a lot of native nations, women would often lead war parties and participate in battles. how about buffalo cathro woman of the northern cheyenne in what is now montana? in the late 1800s, she and her family were camping near a creek when a group of white soldiers attacked. when her brother fell in the fight, she rode into battle and rescued him. about a week later, with her colt 45, buffalo calfro woman would fight in the battle of the little bigghorn. and though we don't know for sure, there are plenty of stories from several tribal nations that claim it was a woman who dealt kuster the final blow. other native women took on the roles of leaders and diplomats in times of conflict. in fact, one of the strongest native american confederacies, the hodnosi, was co-founded by a native woman named chukon sensei. let me tell you her story. oh. way back before european arrival, there were five waring nations. the kauga, the mohawk, onida, onendaga, and saka. jon sensei didn't want any part of that war. but she lived along a war road, one that warriors from every nation traveled. so instead of shutting the door and turning them away, she offered shelter and food to anyone who came through. she even helped resolve arguments between members of different nations. mhm. meanwhile, a man named peacemaker was looking to end the war and unify the five nations, which makes sense, name like that. h. after hearing about jacon sensei, peacemakers set out to see her kindness for himself. he told her about his vision for a unified nation, describing a long house with a representative from each nation in their own seat. because she was neutral and well-liked, peacemaker asked jon sensei to assist him in establishing a system of governance based on peace. he gave her the name mother of nations, and she would go on to be instrumental in the formation of the hodnosi confederacy. thanks in part to jakon sensei, hodnosi law recognizes the equal responsibilities of women and men in all manners, which still guides their practices today. that's right. in that good way. and that's the story of jacon sensei. mhm. all these women are definitely inspiring, but not every native american tribe has treated women and men as equals, which has become something of a sticky misconception. and while it is flattering, it's also flattening because it smooths out the diversity among native american cultures. while we're all pretty awesome, we're also hundreds of different tribes with different cultures and values. like not all tribes are matriarchal. some divided labor strictly along gender lines and others men held most of the wealth and power. and to add a further twist, native people didn't always think about gender in the same way as europeans. in da culture, for example, the nadle embrace both masculine and feminine energies, and the da view them as sacred. and native hawaiians have historically recognized people who identify as mahu, a word that goes beyond gender and serves as a bridge between male and female. the point is, while plenty of native cultures had some equality between men and women, there was also no single way of thinking about gender. but the onset of european colonization disrupted gender roles as it did so many other things. so many europeans didn't vibe with the way women held power in many native societies. as lagona pblo scholar polygon allen put it, the colonizers saw and rightly that as long as women held unquestioned power of such magnitude, attempts at a total conquest of the continents were bound to fail. northern cheyenne have a saying, ""a nation is not defeated until the hearts of its women are on the ground."" so colonizers got to work dismantling that power. they stripped native women of the roles and rights they had for centuries. at times, this looked like elevating men to positions of power, but more often than not, it came in the form of violence toward native women. now, we're about to get into some dark history. this is heavy stuff, and it's important to take care. violence against native women wasn't a passive byproduct of colonization. it was targeted and strategic. women were often singled out because of their ability to bear children, the very thing that was seen as sacred by many tribes. by killing native women, colonizers could destabilize native populations, which was part of a broader effort to destroy and replace native people with european settlers. that's a core part of settler colonialism, which you can learn more about in episode one. this violence had disastrous and widespread consequences. thousands of native women were abused and killed, and tribal culture was permanently altered for many native nations like the chalkaw, whose matrineal system of heritage was marginalized by colonial society. unfortunately, this type of violence continued to haunt the united states for centuries. it still does. for example, in the 1970s, the federal government authorized the secret sterilization of thousands of native women, at least 36 of whom were under the age of 21. one study found that between 1973 and 1976, 1 in4 american indian women were sterilized without their consent. some scholars have described violence against native women as rare in native american societies before the arrival of europeans, though today it's a very different story. native american women face some of the highest rates of violence in the nation, and nearly 96  of it is committed by non-natives. the cdc's data from 2018 to 2023 shows that the third leading cause of death for native women ages 15 to 24 was homicide. and for ages 25 to 44, it's in the top 10. those numbers likely underrepresent the actual scale of violence. a 2022 report by amnesty international found that most law enforcement agencies either don't record native women's ethnicity, mislabel them as hispanic, or lump them into a catch-all category of other. this has caused an untold number of native women's stories to effectively disappear. to make matters worse, crimes in indian country are difficult to bring to justice because in many cases, native american law enforcement isn't able to prosecute non-native criminals. we get more into this and other complications of federal indian law in episode 16. thankfully, native activism is making some headway on this front. the missing and murdered indigenous women movement or mmiw is spreading awareness and advocating for policy change to address the violence against indigenous women, indigenous fems, indigenous twospirit and indigenous girls. and it's making an impact. in 2020, thanks in part to this activism, the not invisible act was signed into law. it created a federal commission to develop methods for identifying, reporting, and responding to instances of missing persons, murder, and human trafficking on indian lands and of indians. the act itself was authored by then representative deb holland, a member of the lagona pueblo nation and the first native woman to serve as us secretary of the interior. hey, the first indian head of the bureau of indian affairs. how revolutionary. thank you, deb. thank you, deb. and of course, activism and leadership by native american women is nothing new and extends beyond the scope of mmiw alone. consider ladonna harris, a comanche activist who in the 1960s spearheaded oklahoma's for indian opportunity, the very first intertribal coalition in the state. this was a big deal in an era when people from many different native nations had begun coming together in new and powerful ways to advocate for improved conditions. harris went on to serve on lynden b. johnson's national council on indian opportunity and later to found americans for indian opportunity, a much broader version of the work she'd begun in oklahoma. and let's hear it for eloise cobell, also known as yellowbird woman. she was a tribal elder, activist, banker, and a member of the black feetat nation who grew up hearing stories about tribal members not getting payments they were owed for use of their land held in trust by the federal government. years later, when she became treasurer of the black feet nation, she witnessed evidence of it herself. she found records of oil being extracted from black feet land, but no record of any payments. so, in 1996, coobel led the charge in holding the government accountable. she brought a class action lawsuit against the united states for mismanaging trust funds of over 500,000 native americans. it was a long fight, but in 2010, coobel versus salazar culminated in a  3.4 billion settlement that went toward getting tribal members the payments they were owed, restoring fractioned land to tribal governments, and starting a scholarship fund. rest in peace, eloise. and plenty of non-native women have been inspired by the work of native women, including many early american feminists. take matilda jocelyn gage, a 19th century leader in the women's suffrage movement. she grew up in new york state where the hodnosone confederacy was based. you know, the one our girl jacconson say helped establish. as she and others became increasingly frustrated by resistance to the women's movement, they found inspiration in their indigenous neighbors. gage once wrote of the hodnosone confederacy, ""never was justice more perfect. never was

",US,16800000,1661,2025-10-07,2025,702,11.7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zwgHBrGxtk,"This is a map of the 574 federally recognized tribal nations in what's now known as the United States. And there's something weird about it. Well, there's a lot of things weird about it, but let's look at this one. A full 40% of those tribes are in Alaska alone. And hold on, none of them are in Hawaii. What's going on here? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] In many ways, Alaska and Hawaii are exceptions. They're the only two US states that are non-ontiguous or not connected to the mainland. And the relationships between their native populations and the US government are pretty unique, both in comparison to the other 48 states and to each other. Let's start with Alaska, which is huge. It's bigger than Texas, California, and Montana combined. If it's not the negative50°ree winters that'll get you, it'll be the mosquito fililled summers when the sun never goes down. But Alaskan naves have thrived here for at least 10,000 years, living not just on these lands, but with them. Traditionally, they've oriented their lives around a subsistence lifestyle of hunting, fishing, and gathering with the seasons. The native nations of Alaska fall into five major cultural groups, each with their own distinct languages, customs, art forms, and histories. And they're divided pretty evenly across the state. You've got the Aabaskcans or Denna in the interior, the Inupia and St. Lawrence Island up in the north, the Upupic and Chupek in the southwest, the Aliu Analutic in the southern stretch of islands, and the Haida, Kling, Shimshihan, and Eoch peoples along the southeastern coast. Alaskan natives assemble. In some ways, these tribes experiences of colonization mirror what happened to native people down south. They've dealt with disease, forced conversion to Christianity, and a devastating loss of land, culture, and lives. But in other ways, what happened to Alaska is its own unique story. For starters, their first colonizers were Russians. Alaskan natives relationship with Uncle Sam didn't begin until 1867 when the US purchased Alaska from Russia for 7.2 $.2 million, which comes out to about 2 cents an acre. That'd be a pretty good deal if the land wasn't, you know, stolen. Over the next few decades, Alaska became a military district, then a mining district, then in 1912, a US territory. But all the while, Alaskan were like, ""H hello, this land is still ours."" They never had actually seated the land in a treaty or lost it in a war. Russia just kind of moved in. So Alaskan natives claimed what the US had purchased wasn't actually the land itself, but the right to negotiate for it with them. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Alaskan natives declared their right to the land as its original occupants through legal assertions called land claims. But these were never fully resolved. For the most part, the US didn't force Alaskan natives off the land like they done to so many native people in the lower 48. But that doesn't mean they were treated any better. For three years during World War II, the US forced over 800 aliu into squalid internment camps where many died. I'm going to pause for a moment and let that sink in. All over, Alaskan natives faced overt discrimination from settlers. Businesses commonly posted signs like no natives allowed and natives need not apply. A practice that wasn't banned until a clinket activist Elizabeth Peratrovich campaigned the state to pass an anti-discrimination law in 1945. When Alaska finally became the 49th state in 1959, the Alaska State Act recognized the native claim to land titles they already held. So that's good. But the act also said the state could claim any 104 million acres of public land it wanted so long as it was vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved. But since Alaskan natives never seated their lands, to say that any land was unappropriated and unreserved was a stretch. Often the lands the state called dibs on were traditional hunting and fishing areas near native villages. Understandably, many Alaskan natives felt downright disrespected by these actions. So, in 1966, more than 400 representatives from 17 native organizations formed the Alaska Federation of Natives with the goal of filing land claims all over the state. They pushed for a land freeze, demanding no new claims by the state until native land claims were settled, and the US government agreed. Then, in 1971, a groundbreaking settlement was reached. The Alaskan Native Claim Settlement Act or the ANCSA, Alaskan Natives agreed to give up their claim of the whole state, all 360 million acres. In return, they receive a smaller slice, 43.7 million acres and 962.5 million. That land and money would be split among a bunch of newly formed corporations, which Alaskan natives could use to benefit native communities. No native nation in the lower 48 had done anything like this. It was powerful, but the tribes still weren't fed recognized nations, which matters a lot for issues of sovereignty or the ability to self-govern. There's much more on tribal sovereignty in episode 2. Throughout the 1980s, Native Alaskan communities advocated for this recognition in state courts until finally in 1993, the US government recognized all Alaskan Native entities, meaning all those corporations as officially sovereign governments with the same protections, powers, and limitations as any other fedally recognized native nation. And that's why today a whopping 229 of the 574 fedally recognized native nations in the US are in Alaska. Weird, but true. Now, let's fly over to Hawaii. The story here is kind of the opposite. There are no fairly recognized native nations, and it might surprise you to learn that many Native Hawaiians don't want there to be. But to understand why, we've got to wrap our heads around their unique relationship with the United States. Native Hawaiians, who call themselves Kuckamali, are the descendants of Polynesian navigators who arrived on the islands more than 2,000 years ago. They developed specialized ways of thriving there like slashing, burning, and rotating patches of jungle as gardens and building canals and terraces that directed water towards their crops. And the Kanuka Maui have nurtured a profound connection to these islands. To this day, many keep relationships with ancestral spirits or omokua, thought to sometimes take the form of plants, rocks, and animals. And they recite the kumu liipo, a creation chant that describes how the universe began from an enormous burst of heat, giving rise to day and night, earth and sky, male and female, and a whole family tree of life. But as soon as the first Europeans set foot on the islands in 1778, more and more Western settlers swept in, and in an all too familiar story, they brought diseases that wiped out over 80% of the native population. Yes, unfortunately you heard that right, 80%. Throughout the 19th century, those settlers and their descendants accumulated more influence, land, and wealth, growing rich off of sugar plantations. And as the turn of the century approached, they took it to the next level. See, in 1891, Lelukani became the kingdom of Hawaii's first and last queen. Her power was limited, though, because a few years prior, a militia of white businessmen had forced her brother, literally at gunpoint, to sign away much of it, including native voting rights, while simultaneously giving voting rights to white landowning non-citizens. Their ultimate goal, make Hawaii a US territory and reap the profit. Leelu Ookani, though, refused to recognize these limitations and worked to restore power to the Kunaka Maui. But then in 1893, members of his secret society invaded the palace, backed by over 160 US troops. Leeli Owokani, fearing war if she didn't comply with their demands, gave up her authority. While all that was happening, white elites had been working to Americanize Hawaii, turning the palace into their government's central headquarters, requiring English in schools, and generally trying to cover up any evidence that the Kanaka Maui were ever sovereign at all. In 1898, the US officially annexed Hawaii, claiming it as a US territory. Congress claimed the Hawaiian government was 100% on board with seeding sovereignty, even though over 21,000 Kakamaui citizens had petitioned against it. Over the next 60 years, US citizens from the mainland moved in droves to Hawaii, eventually outnumbering natives. And in 1959 when the US popped the big do you want to become a state question, 93% of voters said yes. But remember, many of those voters were US citizens from the mainland, not natives. And some native scholars and activists argue that the vote didn't follow international rules laid out by the United Nations, like offering independence as a third option on the ballot. Fast forward to 1993, 100 years after a secret club took over a kingdom. The US Congress apologized for how it all went down. They acknowledged that the Americans had conspired illegally to take over a lawful government and that the Kuckamali never directly gave up their land or their sovereignty. Symbolically, apologizing was a huge step, but legally it didn't change anything. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that acknowledging the state of Hawaii's crooked origin story hadn't created any new rights for the Kuckam Maui or restored any claims over their lands. Today, they still don't have formal federal recognition as a sovereign nation. It was all sizzle, no stake. And the Kanaka Maui are divided on if they even want federal recognition. Those in favor say it would make it easier to address inequality and advocate for native interests. But those opposed often argue that the Kingdom of Hawaii still exists. It was and is illegally occupied. Many say that accepting federal recognition would mean giving up the goal of becoming a truly independent nation once more. So, it's a complicated situation. Like other native people in the lower 48, both the Kuck Maui and Alaskan natives have faced political marginalization and discrimination. They've weathered systematic efforts to get rid of their language and culture. And compared to white Americans, they face higher rates of poverty and preventable illness and have more trouble accessing healthcare and education. The Kucka Maui and Alaskan native relationship with the US have taken very different courses from those of many other native nations and that's given rise to totally unique legal situations. The more we learn about them, the better we can understand the diversity of Native American history and Native life today. In our next episode, we're going to talk about indigenous women's history.

are in alaska. weird, but true. now, let's fly over to hawaii. the story here is kind of the opposite. there are no fairly recognized native nations, and it might surprise you to learn that many native hawaiians don't want there to be. but to understand why, we've got to wrap our heads around their unique relationship with the united states. native hawaiians, who call themselves kuckamali, are the descendants of polynesian navigators who arrived on the islands more than 2,000 years ago. they developed specialized ways of thriving there like slashing, burning, and rotating patches of jungle as gardens and building canals and terraces that directed water towards their crops. and the kanuka maui have nurtured a profound connection to these islands. to this day, many keep relationships with ancestral spirits or omokua, thought to sometimes take the form of plants, rocks, and animals. and they recite the kumu liipo, a creation chant that describes how the universe began from an enormous burst of heat, giving rise to day and night, earth and sky, male and female, and a whole family tree of life. but as soon as the first europeans set foot on the islands in 1778, more and more western settlers swept in, and in an all too familiar story, they brought diseases that wiped out over 80  of the native population. yes, unfortunately you heard that right, 80 . throughout the 19th century, those settlers and their descendants accumulated more influence, land, and wealth, growing rich off of sugar plantations. and as the turn of the century approached, they took it to the next level. see, in 1891, lelukani became the kingdom of hawaii's first and last queen. her power was limited, though, because a few years prior, a militia of white businessmen had forced her brother, literally at gunpoint, to sign away much of it, including native voting rights, while simultaneously giving voting rights to white landowning non-citizens. their ultimate goal, make hawaii a us territory and reap the profit. leelu ookani, though, refused to recognize these limitations and worked to restore power to the kunaka maui. but then in 1893, members of his secret society invaded the palace, backed by over 160 us troops. leeli owokani, fearing war if she didn't comply with their demands, gave up her authority. while all that was happening, white elites had been working to americanize hawaii, turning the palace into their government's central headquarters, requiring english in schools, and generally trying to cover up any evidence that the kanaka maui were ever sovereign at all. in 1898, the us officially annexed hawaii, claiming it as a us territory. congress claimed the hawaiian government was 100  on board with seeding sovereignty, even though over 21,000 kakamaui citizens had petitioned against it. over the next 60 years, us citizens from the mainland moved in droves to hawaii, eventually outnumbering natives. and in 1959 when the us popped the big do you want to become a state question, 93  of voters said yes. but remember, many of those voters were us citizens from the mainland, not natives. and some native scholars and activists argue that the vote didn't follow international rules laid out by the united nations, like offering independence as a third option on the ballot. fast forward to 1993, 100 years after a secret club took over a kingdom. the us congress apologized for how it all went down. they acknowledged that the americans had conspired illegally to take over a lawful government and that the kuckamali never directly gave up their land or their sovereignty. symbolically, apologizing was a huge step, but legally it didn't change anything. in 2009, the supreme court ruled that acknowledging the state of hawaii's crooked origin story hadn't created any new rights for the kuckam maui or restored any claims over their lands. today, they still don't have formal federal recognition as a sovereign nation. it was all sizzle, no stake. and the kanaka maui are divided on if they even want federal recognition. those in favor say it would make it easier to address inequality and advocate for native interests. but those opposed often argue that the kingdom of hawaii still exists. it was and is illegally occupied. many say that accepting federal recognition would mean giving up the goal of becoming a truly independent nation once more. so, it's a complicated situation. like other native people in the lower 48, both the kuck maui and alaskan natives have faced political marginalization and discrimination. they've weathered systematic efforts to get rid of their language and culture. and compared to white americans, they face higher rates of poverty and preventable illness and have more trouble accessing healthcare and education. the kucka maui and alaskan native relationship with the us have taken very different courses from those of many other native nations and that's given rise to totally unique legal situations. the more we learn about them, the better we can understand the diversity of native american history and native life today. in our next episode, we're going to talk about indigenous women's history. and i will see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course native american history, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis, indiana, and was

But did you know that many of those men, the ones who built New York Skyline, were native known as the Skywalkers? These Mohawk iron workers braved the heights to create the Big Apple you know today. They literally built one of the most famous cities in the world. So why do we rarely talk about natives living in cities? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] In episode 14, we talked about the relocation and termination era, the period between the 1950s and60s when the US government attempted to get rid of Native Americans altogether through two main methods. Relocating Native individuals to cities where they would assimilate or disappear into mainstream American culture and ending the federal recognition of over a 100 tribes. It was a rough time or not a vibe in Gen Z terms. Today, we're going to grapple with the fallout from that first element, relocation, and how it created a whole new way to be Indian, for better or worse. Let's kick back up in the early 1950s. Like I mentioned in episode 14, in the wake of World War II, the US federal government was looking for ways to cut cost. All those nukes cost money. And on the chopping block yet again was fulfilling their agreements to native people, this time on reservations. So through some complicated maneuvering, they moved many of us off of reservations and into luxurious beach cabanas. Just kidding. They moved us into cities. The new commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or BIA, Dylan S. Meyer, thought reservations were overpopulated and not worth investing in. So his plan was to offer Native Americans a one-way ticket to the city where they could blend into mainstream society. That would leave their reservation lands ready and available for taxation and sale. With no reservations and NATO's fully assimilated, the government would get out of the promises they had made in treaties and would close the Bureau of Indian Affairs for good. Goodbye reservations. Goodbye treaty promises. Goodbye Indians. This plan came from the same guy who' led the forced interament of more than 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. So yeah, yikes. Rest assured, the ancestors had a word with him in the afterlife. The cornerstone of Meyer's plan was a relocation program which the Bureau of Indian Affairs launched in 1953. It offered a paid ride and a month's stipen to any native person willing to relocate to a city, promising they'd find plenty of good jobs, good schools, and good housing. Basically, the stuff of a better life. Eventually, the BIA added job training to the mix. So many natives were willing to relocate that the BIA got more applications than it could actually accept. But for many, those big promises weren't what they were cracked up to be. Instead of prosperity, many natives found scarce housing and low-end jobs. They experienced culture shock and racism, all without the support of their communities back home. Many native people left. Others wanted to leave, but had no way of getting back to their reservations. Between 1953 and 1973, it's estimated that at least 100,000 Native Americans moved to cities like Chicago, Denver, LA, San Francisco, and Cleveland. Yes, even Cleveland. Those poor souls. And the BIA didn't measure the relocation program success by how well people did in those cities, but how many people were still in those cities a year later, whether they wanted to be or not. Because as long as natives were off reservations to the US government, they were now invisible. And in some ways natives who live in cities are still invisible. Because while we know that today a lot of native folks live urban lives, we don't actually know how many. Like the 2020 US census found that nearly seven in 10 people who identify as American Indian or Alaskan Native live in urban areas. But three years earlier, researchers at the Department of Housing and Urban Development had reported exactly the opposite. The math ain't mathing. It turns out that there are a couple things going on here. For one, on the census, the American Indian category includes anyone with indigenous ancestry from anywhere in the Americas, not just what's now the US. Like two of the most common identities reported in 2020 were Aztec and Maya. Groups that go back hundreds or even thousands of years down in Mexico, our brothers from down under. But second, the census reflects how many people self-identified as having indigenous ancestry, which doesn't necessarily mean someone is a tribal member. Like in 2023, the Cherokee Nation had 450,000 enrolled members. And the smaller Cherokee bands, the United Cuba Band and the Eastern Band, each had more than 14,000 members. Nothing to sneeze at, but over three times that many people had reported Cherokee ancestry on the census. What is it with the math around here? Well, some of that discrepancy comes from different definitions of who counts as Cherokee. It's impossible to know how many of those 1.5 million people who claim native ancestry actually meet the requirements for tribal membership versus how many of them have heard a family story about their great great grandma who was a Cherokee princess. Cuz actually, the Cherokee never had princesses. The point is, nobody's 100% sure how many native people today live in cities. Not even me, and I usually know everything. Side note, to this day, native people living in cities sometimes get described as urban Indians. But that can create a kind of false dichotomy between city Indians and res Indians. While urban Indians don't really exist, native people experiencing urban life do. Besides, there are Indians living everywhere, even in space. Who let you up there, chief? you see ET anywhere? And you might be like, Chay, who cares if we don't know the exact number? We know it's a lot. Isn't that enough? Can't you just be happy? But here's the thing. Not being counted matters. Policies are only as good as the data they're informed by. If we don't have the data, then we don't know how much money to allocate to important programs, which is a big deal when natives living in cities experience poverty and unemployment at higher rates than other Americans, among other difficulties. Take the Indian Health Service, the fedally funded health care provider for members of federally recognized tribes. Despite the high population of native people in urban areas, only 1% of IHS's budget is earmarked for cities. So, urban clinics are few and far between. Even if a native person does live in a city with one of these clinics, lack of time and money can make it hard to get to one. But urban Indian organizations are striving to change that. For example, the National Urban Indian Family Coalition, a group of 40 nonprofits, led the hashtag statistically significant campaign, which encouraged natives and cities to respond to the 2020 US census so that their numbers could be counted and their needs met. And so that maybe one day the math can math. And that points to something huge that the BIA didn't anticipate. Native people didn't just disappear in cities. Instead, these seemingly invisible native people looked for and found each other. Despite many tribal differences, they found common ground and used it to voice their collective power. Intertribal activist organizations like the Red Power Movement and its offshoot, the American Indian Movement, sprouted in cities during the 1960s and 70s, promoting native pride and organizing protests to call attention to injustices. People from many different native nations came together to assert their treaty rights. improve living conditions and fill in the gaps where the government had failed them. Like in the late 1960s, members of the American Indian Movement in Minneapolis, Minnesota, tried to figure out how to address problems for native folks like housing discrimination and isolation from their cultures. And in 1973, Little Earth was born, the first and only subsidized housing complex in the US to give preference to natives. To this day, Little Earth offers services for native residents like rides to school, food banks, and doctor visits, tutoring and support groups. There's an urban farm that grows medicinal plants like sweetgrass and sage. A nightly community patrol to deescalate conflict, an arts collective, seasonal ceremonies, and pow-wows and mentorship from elders. Today, Little Earth is home to about 1,000 residents from more than 30 native nations, and it's just one of many cross-tribal organizations and cultural centers that continue to maintain native community in urban areas. So, relocation created a whole new experience for native people, one of managing their traditions and cultural identity while in an urban setting, and it caused native people from totally different tribes to come together in new ways. Sounds pretty good, right? As with so many things, there's a flip side to this. What if coming together across native cultures actually made natives less visible, not more? I'll let Cherokee scholar and activist Robert Thomas explain. In the 1970s, he warned that natives living in cities were at risk of being cut off from their cultures and the natural world. He feared that unique tribal identities would soon be replaced by a single idea of what it means to be Indian. Like instead of having New York style pizza, Chicago style pizza, and Detroit style pizza, we just had pizza. This idea is called panindianism. It's a political philosophy that's either positive or negative depending on your perspective. Some native people see it as representing intertribal unity and working towards common goals, while others see it as a blending together of distinct tribal identities into generic sameness. To this day, natives debate whether panindianism in cities is good or bad. Does banning together over a common Indianness support native nation sovereignty or does it threaten it? Scholar Sydney Anne Beckman argues that this debate is missing the forest for the trees. It perpetuates quote the idea that indigenous people and cultures cannot exist in urban spaces and that indigenous land ends at city limits which as we've seen couldn't be further from the truth. It's not the possibility of Native urban life that's up for debate. It's the quality of it. No matter their perspective, there's no denying that Native Americans are here in full force. We're in cities just as much as we're on reservations, and we've refused to be invisible in a variety of ways, like by banning together to provide mutual support and by celebrating our uniqueness across cultures. Today, 50 years after relocation officially ended, we continue to define and redefine what it means to be native in the city. As the Cheyenne and Arapjo writer Tommy Orange wrote, ""The city made us new, and we made it ours."" Next time, we're dive into the unique histories of Alaskan natives and Native Hawaiians, and I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-09-23,2025,644,10.733333333333333,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QIbyjF5FRw,"Oh, for me. All right. This week's episode, Federal Indian Law. Good luck. No. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and this is Crash Course Native American History. What if you had a passport that wouldn't let you come home? In 2010, the Hon Nationals planned to fly to the United Kingdom to compete in the World Lacrosse Championships, a sport the Honosi invented, by the way, but the US refused to recognize the players passports and the UK wouldn't let them in if they couldn't go back home. And to understand why, we've got to talk about this. Well, not this exactly, but an equally confusing tangle called Federal Indian Law. So what is federal Indian law? Basically, it comprises all the legal decisions past and present that affect native people's lives today. But it's also really difficult to describe because it's not just one thing. It's thousands of treaties, executive orders, administrative decisions, statutes, and court cases. It's hundreds of years of interactions between tribes and the federal government. It's, in a word, a lot. Even some government websites have called it things like incredibly complex. Again, a lot like this. So, why is there a separate set of rules for Native Americans? Well, federal Indian law exists because native nations never gave up their sovereignty, the inherent right to govern themselves, something you can learn more about in episode 2. That right remained even after the United States was founded, which you can learn about in um pretty much every episode of the series. Under federal Indian law today, tribes are legally considered domestic dependent nations, which means they're sovereign, yes, but Congress can put limits on their sovereignty. And those moving boundaries are what make federal Indian law so complex. Clear as mud? Don't worry, we're going to break it down. We're considering examples across multiple levels to see how federal Indian law affects individuals, entire communities, and land. though, as you'll see, there's a lot of overlap between the three. Let's start on the individual level. Returning to our athletic friends, the Hosoni lacrosse team, in 2010, the US said they wouldn't accept the trib's passports as legit for re-entry because they didn't recognize the Hneson as a fully sovereign nation. In other words, if it's not a real nation, it can't make a real passport. Never mind, the Honi citizens had been able to travel internationally for over 20 years by that point. But they did offer the lacrosse players an exception. Fly with the passports just as once. But the players didn't want a one-time thing. They wanted full recognition of their right to self-govern. So they chose to miss their tournament rather than accept anything less. This is just one piece of the puzzle, one example out of thousands of ways, large and small, that these laws impact native people. And not just international lacrosse teams, but your neighbors, teachers, and friends. and sometimes with dire consequences. Just a heads up, I'm about to go into some pretty heavy truths, so please take care as you watch on. Today, there is a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. Indigenous women are killed at a rate 10 times higher than the national average. They're more likely than other populations to be assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, and the vast majority identify their attackers as nonIndians. But under federal law, tribes are limited in what they can do to solve these crimes because they generally don't have full authority to prosecute non-Indians, which goes back to those fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. Federal Indian law says tribal nations have the right to govern themselves, but not to exercise governance over non-natives. So, criminals can sometimes go unpunished through this loophole. The Violence Against Women Act has tried to address this problem by giving tribes jurisdiction over non-Indians in instances of sexual violence, stalking or assault on tribal land. But even then, tribal ability to punish non-Indians remains limited. Because the laws are so complicated, indigenous women are treated differently from other victims. And usually, this means the investigations are a lot slower, which makes it all too easy for the cycle of violence to continue. Like I said, this is heavy stuff, but I hope the more that we understand it, the more we can work to solve it. Now, we've seen how federal Indian law can impact individuals when traveling or when victims of a crime. But to take it even further, let's look at how the law impacts whole communities. To start, have you noticed I keep using the word Indian rather than Native American? Well, that's because federal Indian law only applies to American Indians, which unlike Native American, is the official legal term for enrolled members of federally recognized tribes. My eyes hurt from all the fine print, y'all. There are many people who are members of a tribe, but whose tribe isn't recognized as a nation by the US governments. So, they aren't covered under the American Indian label, at least by law. On top of that, each tribe has its own requirements for membership. So, you can't just say I'm Navajo based on your 23 and me results any more than I can say I'm a Swedish citizen based on my Swedish chef impression. Anyway, there's more about native identity in episode 4. Now, whether or not we're recognized as Indian by the government doesn't change the fact that we're US citizens with all the perks that come with that, like the right to vote. But in other ways, it could have a huge impact, like massive. See, as of 2024, 574 tribes are federally recognized as tribal nations. And since the 1830s, the US government has abided by what's called a trust responsibility to those tribes. Basically, that means it has a legal and moral obligation to protect them and their members forever. That obligation is based on interpretations of the Constitution, statutes, and treaties. The trust responsibility through a government agency called the Bureau of Indian Affairs or BIA helps fund basic services like schools and electricity. They build and maintain roads, bridges, and dams on reservations. There's a division for fighting wildfires, a division for connecting reservations to highspeed internet, and a program for bringing bison back to tribal lands. Sadly, they rejected my suggestion for an Indian taco division. There's even a branch of tribal climate resilience which is all about supporting tribes ability to adapt to a warming world and that could have huge impacts on communities like since 2022 the Senoma Indian tribal community has gotten support from the BIA to revive their traditional practice of clam gardening. Clam gardens have been maintained for centuries by the Swanomish. The gardens are filled with minerals that help clams build shells, which in turn creates a more stable tidal ecosystem and offers protection from things like sea level rise and ocean acidification. One Swenomish tribal member, Joe Williams, describes the program as looking to our ancestors playbook on how to adapt to climate change. So, the trust responsibility at the core of federal Indian law can be acted out in a lot of helpful ways, but this support is only offered to federally recognized tribes. Meanwhile, hundreds of tribes don't have federal recognition. Many have their recognition legally terminated by the US government, and it's a long, difficult, expensive process to get it back, which you can learn more about in episode 14. For those tribes, there is no government support. Okay, I think I think I got it. Wait, never mind. Where were we? Right. The ever complex tango of law. So, we've seen how federal Indian law impacts individuals and whole communities. Now, let's look at how it applies to land. And really, all these layers are connected. Take the term Indian country. To us, that's just another word for home. But it's also a legal term that broadly describes land held in trust for Native American tribes, which includes lots of different types of lands. All of it governed by federal Indian law. All told, about 56 million acres of land in Indian country is held in trust by the federal government. That means while the land officially exists for the benefit of the individual tribe or Indian, the federal government holds its legal title. Which means tribes face far more barriers to using their land than private land owners would. Like in 2014, a crow citizen followed a herd of elk off his reservation and into a national forest, then carried the meat back home. The state of Wyoming found him guilty of hunting elk illegally off his reservation. But sometimes federal Indian law can actually be used to defend the rights of tribal members. The Crow tribe brought this case all the way to the Supreme Court. They pointed to the 1868 treaty where they seated much of their land with the guarantee that they'd still be able to hunt on it. The Supreme Court sided with the Crow tribe and affirmed that they still had the right to hunt on the land as they always had. So yeah, federal Indian law is complicated. It's a complex puzzle made of centuries old treaties and court cases decided as recently as today. This sprawling body of law affects individual native people, our community, and even our land. But like I said before, all these things are connected. The law continues to evolve, and we continue to fight to affirm our sovereignty to this day. Speaking of which, the Hon Nationals didn't stop fighting for theirs. In 2022, they flew to Ireland for the World Lacrosse Championships where they were welcomed with open arms and a stamp on their Hesony passports. Next time, we'll talk about what it means to be a native in the city. And I will see you then.

You are probably under the spell of these words right now. This is a story about words. Words that alter the course of history. Words that hold invisible power. Power that can be used for good or for evil. Hi, I'm Amanda Montel and I'm a devoted follower of the cult of social science. I'm a social commentator with a background in linguistics and the author of non-fiction books including cultish and the age of magical overthinking. Welcome to a crash course lecture. [Music] If I described my yoga studio as a cult, a certain image might come to mind. It's not a cult really, but there's something about it that's definitely cultish. Cultesque, and that's something, it's language. The language some fitness studios use is striking. It's driven by ideology, ritual, even dogma. They promise a kind of belonging that isn't necessarily bad, but it is at the very least alternative. And it's not just yoga studios and CrossFit gyms. There's cultishness in the places we work, the places we go for fun, and in our social media feeds. This kind of language is everywhere. Each of us is constantly influenced by the very same language strategies that created notorious cults like Jonestown, Heavensgate, and Cinon. Cultishness has been around throughout human history, but it's different now, ramped up. If you ask me, today we're living in the most cultish era of all time. Why? It's complicated. The modern world is chaotic. Our systems are riddled with labor and wealth imbalances. Ads and influencers are pushing us to consume more, while environmentalists warn us we should be consuming less. And the crushing pressure to self-brand online has made us so anxious that our cravings for validation have become insatiable. Not speaking from experience or anything. In the past, during times of turmoil, many people found at least some comfort or guidance from traditional authority figures like church leaders, the government, news reporters, and medical providers. But here in the US over the last 50 years, our faith in institutions has been in steady decline. So much for comfort and guidance. Meanwhile, in my friend group, we often joke about starting a commune to deal with housing costs. A compound just makes sense in this economy. Are we joking, though? [Music] These conundrums are all eerily familiar. They remind me a great deal of another time in history that I am very familiar with. They remind me of the world my dad Craig grew up in in the 1960s. I was raised on my dad's stranger than fiction tales. Stories of this remote stretch of land in California where kids didn't go to a real school and adults had to shave their heads if they broke a rule. Stories about how his parents, seeking a life free from the obsession with work and wealth, took him and his halfsisters and joined a cult. This tale starts in 1969, a time of incredible socopolitical unrest in the United States. We're on the heels of the John F. Kennedy assassination and civil rights movement were in the throws of the Vietnam War. In the face of all this, in the 1960s and '7s, countercultural groups started springing up full of people seeking ways to thrive without relying on those systems. from Woodstock era hippies and transcendental meditators to more sinister groups like the way international and Scientology. It was so dramatic that some scholars refer to this period in the mid- 20th century as the fourth great awakening, grouping it together with other major religious transitions in American history. And here we find my dad or the person who would become my dad because Craig was all of 14 when he moved with his family to Cinon. Cinanon was a community that started as an alternative drug rehab center but expanded to attract lifestylers like my grandparents. That was the word for so-called squares who didn't need rehab but still wanted in on this lifestyle experiment. Best thing for people is people and Cinon provides the environment to bring together peoples from all walks of life. Cinon was the antidote to all the problems of the modern day. Offering a template for who to be and how to live morally, sustainably, healthfully, which I get. It relieved some of that stress I mentioned at the start. It provided that missing comfort and guidance. And at its best, Cinanon was saving people's lives. Moving there was truly transformative for many, including talented artists and musicians who chose to trade their addictions for playing nightly tunes and getting high on nothing but group bonding. But from my dad's perspective, things in Cinon were a little weird. Like everyone dressed alike. Overalls, short haircuts. It was actually pretty hip by today's standards. Cult chic, compound casual. members used all kinds of special words and did mandatory rituals. But the thing that really freaked out my dad was how everyone was so obsessed with Cinanon's visionary leader, Chuck Dedric, a normal guy who they treated as a man god. So my dad became a loner just trying to fly under the radar. As I grew up, I became fascinated by groups like this, wondering what drives the irrational and overly uniform beliefs within them. And I started to notice something. The same kind of language that Cinanon used to recruit and isolate their followers. It was everywhere. This language can be found in our everyday lives, manipulating us even and especially in places we wouldn't expect. [Music] But pause. Before we get much deeper, we should figure out what the word cult even means. Because on the surface, an exercise bike company and a sober compound in the hills don't have all that much in common. I've heard it said that cults are like porn. It's a joke that references a famous 1964 Supreme Court case where when asked for a definition of pornography, Justice Potter Stewart said, ""I know it when I see it."" As soon as I say the word cult, you might picture a certain image of robes, a kind of dazed look, super long hair, dirty feet. But that's just a stereotype. The word cult hasn't always had sinister undertones at all. Let's take a detour to the 17th century. The earliest written usage of cult traces back to the 1600s when the word meant homage paid to divinity or offerings to win over the gods. 200 years later, by the mid 1800s, cult evolved to mean a kind of churchly categorization, more like sect, used specifically to describe ancient or primitive systems of religious belief. The word conoted something unorthodox maybe, but not necessarily malignant. Around this time, dozens of sociospiritual clicks were cropping up and fading in the US. Polyamorous communists, egalitarian inventors, vegan farmers. There was basically a cult or sect for anyone. I mean, one of the reasons the US was founded was for religious freedom. And America had gained a reputation as the sort of place where you were free to get as socioposiritually freaky as you liked. It wasn't until the 1960s and 70s that the word cult started gaining a darker reputation. The mass emergence of non-conformist spiritual groups unsettled traditional Christians. Then came several high-profile cult related tragedies. The Manson family murders of 1969 where celebrities and everyday people were killed in their homes. and the Jonestown massacre of 1978 where over 900 people unwillingly took their lives under the influence of their leader. From there, the word cult was solidified as a national symbol of peril. What followed was a period in the 1980s known as the satanic panic when conspiracy theories about cults abusing suburban kids spread around the US like wildfire. Here's what I find especially interesting, though. As soon as cult became synonymous with harm and infamy in the 70s, it also became kind of cool. That's why we have slang like cult following and cult classic to describe midnight showings of the Rocky Horror Picture Show or the followings of jam bands like the Grateful Dead. This wink wink hyperbolic interpretation of the word to describe devoted fan bases is why I can cheekily reference soul cycle as a cult brand or describe Disney adults as culty. And you know I'm not talking about communes and death. At least hopefully not. Which brings us back to the task at hand. I was supposed to be defining cult here but as you can see it's really hard. You understand how we get to I know it when I see it. Because that's the thing about language. In everyday practice, definitions are determined not by academics or dictionary makers, but by us, the speakers. Meaning depends on the person you're talking to and the context. Like when cult is used to write off groups that mainstream society judges, folk magic practitioners, for example. There's more on that aspect of the term in Crash Course Religions. But when it comes to sinister cults, it can be helpful to have a less vibes driven definition. A number of psychologists have developed rubrics for this. They include things like, does it have a charismatic and idol worshipped leader who offers validation and is the only source of truth and wisdom? Is there abuse, including financial, sexual, and or labor exploitation? Is there extreme paranoia about the outside world and no tolerance for questioning? Is there meaningful financial transparency and is there a viable exit strategy? That's the checklist I tend to use personally and it comes in part from psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton and in part from the Cult Education Institute. There's ongoing disagreement among scholars about what should go on these lists. But the point is when I say something is cultish, it usually checks off at least one of these boxes. The checklist can be applied broadly. Like I can think of some celebrated Hollywood clicks, Silicon Valley companies, and fitness studios that check some of these. And unfortunately, you won't find a major religion that doesn't check some of them either. But I see the world through a socio- linguistics lens. So for me, the most interesting connection here isn't that you can find abuses of power everywhere. It's that you can find the same type of language everywhere. strategic language that holds a lot of power and influence. Society has changed since 1969 when my dad joined Cinon and it's primed us to become the most cultish era ever. [Music] But before we can get into the real cultine, we've got to understand what happened in the 1960s when my dad moved with my grandparents to Cinon. It was a time of cultural turbulence and fear, not all that different from today. But this was also before the internet, before social media. To learn about Cinanon, my grandfather had to get up, leave the house, and talk to people in person. Contain your shock, Jenzie. But in today's world, we're more isolated. In 2024, an American Psychiatric Association poll surveyed over 2,000 American adults and found that 30% had felt lonely every single week during the last year. So, how did this happen? According to a 2024 survey from Harvard, participants reported being overworked, not seeing family enough, a lack of spiritual life, and the biggest culprit for loneliness is digital technology. Let's be real, skimming through your friend's life updates isn't the same as catching up IRL. Add to all this the fact that we've basically got a tragedy on demand machine in our pocket at all times. A 2019 report from John's Hopkins University looked at young people who spent more than 3 hours per day on social media, and it found that those people internalized problems more, making it harder to cope with depression and anxiety. So many of us are more disconnected than ever while also carrying the weight of the world in our pockets. It's like we've forgotten we're humans. We're all about community. It's part of how we managed to survive as a species for so long. And if we're not getting community in person, many will try to fill that relationship void some other way. Cue the heavenly internet. # blessing us with the keys to find any kind of community we could ever want. In a way, that's beautiful. But when I say any kind of community, I mean any kind, including fanatical fringe groups with charismatic leaders who are paranoid about outsiders who think they have all the answers and whose beliefs are dangerous to question. Unlike my grandfather, we don't have to leave our homes to subscribe to new ideologies. We can be profoundly influenced without even leaving the couch. Today, most zealous fringe groups build a digital system of morality and community. And in lie of a physical meeting place, jargon gives them something to assemble around. I'll never forget when I first downloaded Instagram in the summer of 2012. I was struck that the app called its account holders followers instead of friends or connections. It's like a cult platform. I remember saying, ""Is it not encouraging everyone to build their own little cult?"" And while these platforms claim to make an effort to stop truly dangerous ideas and disinformation from spreading, those safety nets certainly don't catch everything. Ultimately, algorithms tend to prioritize spicy content, whether or not it's true. In fact, one 2018 MIT study found it takes true stories about six times longer than false ones to reach 1500 people on the app formerly known as Twitter. Why? Because false information seems more novel, more exclusive, and wise, authentic in its outlandishness. Here's an example of how this has worked. QAnon, a disperate online group which has been linked to real world extremist violence. Q Anon involves a kind of spiderweb of different conspiracy theories, rituals, and buzzwords, all of which promise answers in these uncertain times. The most extreme of QAnon's ideologies attest that an evil cabal of elites or satan worshipping child abusers secretly runs Hollywood, the media, and the Democratic Party. And Donald Trump was divinely sent to save America and the world from this vast evil. Q Anon rose in fame and popularity not through in-person meetings but rather internet forums and social media posts. Qanoners use a glossery of lofty, vague, and everchanging vocabulary like 5D consciousness and do the research in order to intrigue curious recruits who might not get on board with overtly violent language out of the gate. They also do this to avoid the surveillance of social media companies who might be on high alert for QAnon threats and shut down accounts that use certain terminology. It's easy enough to dismiss online cults as not threatening in the real world, but the influence of groups like QAnon has led to very real harm. For example, in 2016, a man radicalized online showed up at a pizza parlor in DC that was the center of a bogus conspiracy theory. It was spread on sites like 4chan, which became a major hub for KQAnon. He opened fire in the restaurant and told police he was there to self-investigate the conspiracy theory. Of course, KQanon is not the cult for everyone. But what about influencer fandoms, which seem positive at first, but end up taking over someone's whole value system? In today's world, many of us find ourselves in parasocial relationships where we feel like we have a special connection with someone we see online. And when someone makes us feel known and seen, especially if we're isolated from the people around us, that's a well doumented risk factor for falling prey to charismatic cult leaders. So in 2025, our ultimate cult leader may be father algorithm and comment sections are new compound. It's easier than ever to fall into nefarious ideas or get wrapped up in something cultish. And the really wild thing is the language tricks that cult leaders use, our brains are actually wired to fall for them. [Music] So, what are those tricks and how do they work? Enter the game. The most memorable of my dad's Cinon stories had to do with something called the game. The game was the centerpiece of Cinon life, and it was essentially a form of endurance training or group therapy where followers gathered around in so-called tribes and were invited to single out other members to verbally berate them. The game could be hostile and even traumatizing. And yet in Cinanon language, it was described as something you played. And playing was required even for kids. It happened several nights a week and might involve, say, one member calling out another with whom they had personal beef and shouting at them for being lazy or spoiled. This was called a pull-up. Then others were encouraged to join in on the vitriol, also known as backing the play. Life in Cinon was framed within two rhetorical categories, in the game and out of the game. And when you were in the game, nothing else in the world existed. After the game was finished, you were supposed to compartmentalize, move on with your daily Cinon tasks as if you hadn't just been verbally maligned for 7 hours, you know. And people say, ""Well, what is the Cinon lifestyle?"" We all play the game here, the Cinon game. and that the contrast between the game and the notame is what makes up the lifestyle. When I heard about all this, I was fascinated by the way Cinanon used euphemisms and insidery buzzwords to reshape followers reality. It sent a shiver down my spine. My dad said that some members, like my grandfather, were actually addicted to it. In this way, the game kind of reminds me of when online comment sections get really heated. You know when people can't stop posting negative or conspiratorial comments, thinking they're calling someone out for some moral infraction, but really they're just aiming for clout and maybe catharsis. Let me know what you think of that idea in the comments below. The Cinon game was like that, but in real life. Describing what it felt like to play the game at 14, my dad said, ""To me, the torrent of heated accusations felt like verbal carpet bombing. I wished I were invisible."" He felt constantly gaslit, trapped in the linguistic prison of the game. Okay, buckle up. Things are about to get nerdy. In linguistics, there's a concept known as the theory of performativity, which argues that language doesn't just describe or reflect our reality, it creates it. The idea here is that speech itself has the ability to cause measurable changes in the world. If that sounds a little hocus pocus, think about when a justice of the peace pronounces a couple married or when an umpire calls you're out. That's how that works, right? Not really in the cult of sports. And in synonyon, that exclusive, heavily repeated jargon, including phrases like in the game and out of the game, plus all the charged verbiage wielded during the game itself, worked to create a new reality for followers. Studies have shown that repeating words and phrases makes our beliefs stronger. This is a describable phenomenon. It's called the illusory truth effect. The illusory truth effect is one of many mental shortcuts that our brains used to make efficient decisions. And for most of human history before a time when misinformation could spread so fast and far online, the illusory truth effect worked well enough. Like picture you're a hunter gatherer. You're not on blue sky, okay? If everyone in your community tells you the red berries in the swamp are poisonous, that's going to stick. It might even save your life when you're out foraging. And if that isn't true, at least it didn't hurt. The trouble is, our minds are still inclined to interpret any repeated phrases as reality. Like, if you heard something repeatedly during the Cinon game, even if it was cruel, even if it was untrue, it could easily start to feel like a fact. And if you wanted to question that, if you confided to a friend that actually you don't think the game is helpful, they might respond with the synonym phrase act as if. Essentially, this was a cue to pretend you agree with the cult's rules until one day you sincerely do. You know that phrase, fake it till you make it? This was kind of like Cinanon's version of that. But in Cinon, act as if was rooted in the belief that anything invented by Chuck Dedrich had to be good because he was supremely wise. Act as if is an example of a cult language technique called the thought terminating cliche. Thought-terminating cliche was coined by psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton in 1961. And it describes a kind of zingy stack expression that's easy to memorize, easy to repeat, and at its worst is aimed at shutting down independent thinking, questioning, or push back. Thought-terminating cliches combined with another linguistic strategy to keep Chuck in power. loaded language, aka emotionally charged labels and buzzwords that meant something innocuous or nothing at all to outsiders, but could be used on followers to create an us versus them mentality or even make psychological threats. Like, does the term splitty mean anything to you? Probably not. But in Cinon, that was the label used to describe those who'd left the group, the ultimate betrayal and cardinal sin. Loaded buzzwords like these are hyper effective because they jive well with our brains tendency to form in-groups and outroups. And again, detecting social patterns like these has historically been really helpful for survival. But when a community's aims are more cerebral than foraging for food, relying on our crude us versus them instincts rather than critical thinking becomes a problem. But to people in Cinon, this might not have felt nefarious at all. It may have even felt fun. In my experience talking to survivors, cultish language is often the first thing you pick up when you get involved with an in-group and the last thing you let go because it's organic, invisible, and seemingly commitment-free. Remember learning pig Latin on the playground as a kid? It was like a secret code, and it immediately made you feel like one of the cool kids, right? What's that? Well, at least I thought they were cool. Anyway, pig Latin is pretty far from synonyon lingo. And so far, you might be thinking you've been able to escape the worst of cultish influence. Trust me, I get it. I'd like to think I have, too. But it's not just infamous cult leaders who've caught on to this. In fact, this kind of manipulative language is sused into our everyday lives in ways we don't even notice. [Music] Introducing corporate jargon. You might not work at a company where people walk around saying things as ridiculous as we need to leverage our synergies to drive innovative solutions. Or maybe you do, in which case, wo. But most companies have some kind of loaded language used to motivate people to work hard and help them feel like they're a part of the company mission. A business scholar named Manfred Frqued Devise explained to me that in the workplace an excess use of slogans, code words, meaningless corporate jargon, and company chance can be a clue in distinguishing if an employer is treading into dangerously cultlike territory. In his words, quote, ""All companies have special terms, and sometimes they make sense, but sometimes they're nonsense."" As a consultant, I sometimes enter an organization where people use acronyms, but they don't actually know what they're talking about. They're just imitating what top management says. A famous example of this is Amazon, a company whose ideals take classic American values like meritocracy, individual ambition, and climbing ladders, and institutionalizes them into what I interpret as a religious dogma of sorts. For example, Amazon has its own version of the Ten Commandments, so to speak, called the leadership principles. They include high flulutent phrases like think big, dive deep, have backbone, and deliver results. According to the New York Times, Amazon encourages employees to memorize the principles when they're hired, then live and breathe them both in and outside the office, like biblical proverbs. Some employees even teach them to their kids. Ex Amazon employee and writer Christy Coulter once told me that some employees misinterpret the leadership principles as a justification for asserting power over their co-workers. Like using the disagree and commit principle as an excuse to pick fights or tear apart fellow employees pitches in meetings almost as a stunt to demonstrate their loyalty to Amazon's mission. Not terribly unlike the Cinon game. In a society where work and consumerism are slowly replacing classical religious institutions as a system of belief and belonging, this kind of language is worth keeping an ear out for. An even more famous example comes from the multi-level marketing industry, aka MLMs. This is Tupperware. You can freeze it, stack it any which way. Within pyramid-shaped MLMs, recruits sell products like leggings or health supplements to their family and friends, in turn, luring these people to become sellers themselves. Recruits are regarded as business owners, even though none of the traditional rules of entrepreneurship apply. MLM acolytes are labeled consultants or distributors. And the higher one moves at the structure, the more grandiose their titles become. Director, executive, triple ground diamond, most distinguished mistress of linguistics. Yeah, I can see why that's appealing. What's fascinating about MLMs is that they're not actually selling financial independence in any concrete way. Instead, they're selling something much more abstract and very American. Optimism. Faith that you can achieve the American dream, even if it's numerically impossible. And that promise is made with this sparkly language. Imagine a note like this sliding into your DMs from an old high school classmate. Hey, girly pop. Loving your posts lately. You have such an amazing energy. Have you ever thought about turning that energy into your own business? I used to be miserable at my old 9 to5 and now I make a full-time living working part-time for myself from home without ever having to leave my little one's side. Would love to grab coffee and tell you more. Data shows that since the Tupperware party days, MLMs tend to target stay-at-home wives and mothers, as well as other demographics like college students and immigrant communities who are generally locked out of the dignified labor market and simultaneously seeking purpose. They also tend to have a strong base of friends and family to recruit from, lots of hope for the future, and at least some spare money and time that they'll likely never get back. Even beyond work, similar strategies stretch into our niche interests, our fandoms. Like, don't get me wrong, I love T-Swift's Red Album. But it isn't lost on me that Swifties have a robust glossery of fan lingo used to build community around their parasocial god. References like Kalor and Gaylers, the numbers 13 and 89, and phrases like not a lot going on at the moment are used to make fans feel part of a movement, to give them power, to show their real devotees above casual listeners, countless internet communities, from fantasy sports leagues to political forums, have loaded language of their own, too. And while it can be used to construct a positive sense of belonging, DFTBA, am I right? It can also create needless us versus them conflicts and shut down independent thought, especially if the people involved don't quite know why they're saying these chants and buzzwords that incite such strong emotions. That language tobrain connection is powerful. It can be used to bind someone to an in-group and make them feel like they can never leave. It can be used to confuse a follower so they start to believe the only way to know what's true and guarantee their safety is to depend on the all- knowing leader forever. [Music] Okay, so we've talked about what a cult is, how language is a cult leader's most powerful and sneakiest tool, and why modern society is so susceptible to these strategies. But there's still a question that haunts me. If cultishness shows up in the words we use every day, if we can hear it around us, then how is it still so effective? Cultish language can actually be really hard to clock because it often evolves slowly. For example, sometimes cult leaders take existing English words that followers have been using their whole lives and gradually twist their meanings until they have a whole new definition that serves the cult. I once interviewed a survivor of the healthy, happy, holy organization or 3HO, a dogmatic condundalini yoga based group who told me that one common English term that meant something totally different to her group was old soul. To most of us, old soul describes someone who's wise beyond their years. It's a positive thing. But to a 3o member, the phrase was warped to mean someone who'd reincarnated life after life and could never get it right. It was threatening and it could be used to frighten followers into obedience because if you broke one of 3's rules, like by eating meat or failing to study scripture at a certain time, you'd be at risk of lowering your vibration and becoming an old soul. In different flavors and with varying aesthetics, this kind of language is used to coers people in all destructive cults. But people don't fall for things like this because they're foolish. In large part, it's because cult leaders are taking advantage of not just the power of language, but also a handful of vulnerabilities that have been hardwired into our heads since the days when we spent most of our time gathering nuts and berries. I see it like this. The brain is like an operating system. Let's call it OS human. In lots of ways, OS human is really advanced these days. It can send a text message and open 250 browser tabs at the same time. Not to brag, but in other ways, it's the same basic operating system we've been using since we started walking upright. For one thing, OS human has a strong natural inclination toward communalism, loyalty to our own group, which we may view as superior to other groups. And this makes sense evolutionarily. The famous biologist Charles Darwin pointed out that for survival purposes, it's ideal to have a relatively small community. Think about it. It's way easier to take care of a few dozen people than a few hundred or a few billion. But our world is much larger now. We're connected to way more people. And yet, OS human hasn't completely updated. We still tend to be fiercely loyal to the insular groups we're a part of. even if they're virtual, even if they're not really our groups in any sense resembling what Darwin was talking about. And here's the thing, that OS human source code was built on some not so reliable foundations. This is due to cognitive biases, psychological tricks that developed in early human brains to help us make efficient decisions with our limited time, memory, and brain power. The illusory truth effect I mentioned earlier is one of them. Another is confirmation bias. This is our tendency to only seek out, notice, and internalize information that validates what we already believe. Confirmation bias can make it hard to accept or even notice new contradictory information. It allows us only to hear what we want to hear. And part of a cult leader's charisma is their ability to intuitit this. Like going back to Jonestown, one survivor named Laura Johnston Cole once told me I was there for political reasons. So Jim thought, ""Every time I see Laura sitting in a meeting, I have to address politics. I let him address my priorities and put blinders on for other things."" This is classic confirmation bias. One more major flaw in OS human, the sunk cost fallacy. This is the belief that if you've already spent resources on something like money and time or even hope and secrets, you can't give that thing up. If you've already sunk 10 years and your life savings into a group that promised you transcendence, you're going to be heavily motivated to justify your choices to prove that any day now the time and hope you put in will pay off. Sun cost fallacy plus thought terminating cliche. Game over. That's the power of cultish language over an operating system full of cognitive biases. [Music] So there are all these factors working against people getting out of cults. Sometimes it can seem nearly impossible to escape. But there is reason for hope. Here's the story of how my dad got out. When my dad was in high school, he was in the thick of it. He was surrounded by friends, family, teachers, doctors. Everyone around him had so fully absorbed the language of Cinanon that there was really no other language spoken. There was no education except cult education. Cinanon kids were required to go to the school on site, which wasn't teaching multiplication tables or multiple perspectives. It was designed to keep them solidly imshed in Cinanon culture. But Craig was simultaneously learning to think in a different way by being exposed to science. He worked in the group's microbiology lab where he'd test followers for diseases because they wanted to avoid outside hospitals. In a way, the lab was his sanctuary. It was the one space in all of Cinanon that was governed by questions and empirical facts. It gave him practice thinking critically and accessing a diversity of information. And as his interest in biology grew, he knew he'd need to go to college if he wanted to continue to learn. That meant he needed an accredited degree from an outside high school. So Craig began hitching rides into San Francisco to attend one against tradition and against the urging of people around him. According to Chuck Dedrich, Cinanon was utopia and leaving it was a death sentence. But Craig did it anyway. And with each passing day, the world of Cinon felt more contrived and toxic. Ultimately, when graduation came, the decision to leave was actually an easy one. In fact, he was desperate to go. So, against the pressure of everyone on the inside, he traded Cinon for college, just in time to witness its downfall from afar. By the late 1970s, Chuck's act as if protocols became harder to follow as his dogma grew more and more extreme. For example, some survivors say when Chuck's doctor told him he needed to lose weight, Chuck forced everyone else in the group to go on strict diets, too, coercing them to participate in humiliating mass weigh-ins in the nude. After Chuck's wife passed away from cancer and he fell in love with someone new, he demanded that everyone else go through the same grief process as a personal growth exercise and he separated all the married couples in Cinanon, then assign them new partners. That was the last straw for Craig's dad and stepmother, and they finally left Cinon in 1977. As time went on, Chuck also became increasingly paranoid about outsiders. that inspired him to scrap one of his original cardinal rules, no violence. He instituted a personal militia called the Imperial Marines, who he mandated to physically beat Splatizes, the traitorous defectors. This all culminated in one last act of violence. Chuck instructed his army to place a rattlesnake in the mailbox of a lawyer representing Splatizes. The snake bit the lawyer, landing him in the hospital, and Chuck Dedrich was arrested. Though due to declining health, he never spent any time in jail. Cinon disbanded shortly thereafter, though remnants of the game still live on in online communities and comment sections. As for my dad, he must have had one heck of a college essay because somehow he got into UC Berkeley, graduated with a degree in bacteriology, then moved on to UCLA where he earned his PhD in microbiology. He went on to marry a fellow research scientist. Hi, Mom. And eventually became a professor. [Music] So Craig got out, but where does that leave the rest of us? We're living in an increasingly complex world teeming with petty problems, overwhelming choices, fractured communities, and a constant onslaught of both true and false information that our brains simply did not develop to handle. So, our cognitive biases sometimes tell us to double down on cultish choices, to stay with that candidate a little longer, to try a final month at that culty fitness studio to buy one more Stanley Cup. Despite enormous evidence that we should reconsider, simply put, our once useful cognitive shortcuts are clashing with the modern world. As for why my dad didn't buy into so many of the cultish strategies that worked on his peers, well, in part, he had his interest in science to think for that. This just goes to show that even in highly oppressive environments, a hint of skepticism can point you toward hope. But short of running a microbiol, what are the rest of us supposed to do about this? What can we take away from my dad's story as people who are exposed to cultish language every day? Well, I argue that being manipulated isn't always bad. Anything can be taken too far. But as a whole, just because something is a little cultish doesn't mean you have to give it up. Because here's the thing, human beings influence each other often times in irrational ways. It's what we do. We're a social and mystical species. And cultish language can be a way to mobilize people for good. Like one of my best friends works at a cancer nonprofit and she's recruited me to do some fundraising for them. This is an objectively good mission that I believe in. But vying for research funding is hard and I've noticed how the mantras and labels used within this nonprofit to keep people inspired can be cultish. Someday is today. You are the greatest generation of warriors and heroes in this quest for a cancer cure. Am I being manipulated when I hear phrases like that? Totally. But when it's safe, respectful, and easy to get out of when you've had enough. Being a little irrational about the things we love together, well, that's a core part of being human. We chant at sports games, cry shouting the same phrases over and over again until we really do believe that our team is unbeatable. We wear special friendship bracelets to concerts and flash funny hand signs at each other to show we belong to communities we love. Is it all a little mystical? Sure. But that's how humans are. And admitting that might just be the key to making the best of our cultish proclivities without letting them take over our lives. I believe that we can strive to preserve the sanctity of facts without giving up the fun of ritual or the might of cultish language. For example, we can use what we know about the illusory truth effect to spread real facts. Pretty fonts, rhyming slogans, and constant repetition aren't just for cult leaders. Memory scientist Lisa Fosio once told me, ""Remember, it's okay to repeat true information. People need reminders of what's true."" Ultimately, my goal with my writing is to be more compassionate toward others irrationalities and skeptical of my own in this ever complicated and culty age. I think that's the best each of us can do. And with that, I suppose all I can say is stay curious, stay critical. And dare I say, amen.

to bend people to your will. what if there were whole vocabularies of these complicated mazes of buzzwords, mantras, euphemisms, cliches, and redefinitions? and these all add up to a kind of spellbook that a select few of history's greatest influencers secretly possess. from jesus to jim jones to jeff bezos, but also taylor swift, pelaton instructors, and even old friends selling essential oils in your dms. and here is the kicker. you are probably under the spell of these words right now. this is a story about words. words that alter the course of history. words that hold invisible power. power that can be used for good or for evil. hi, i'm amanda montel and i'm a devoted follower of the cult of social science. i'm a social commentator with a background in linguistics and the author of non-fiction books including cultish and the age of magical overthinking. welcome to a crash course lecture.  music  if i described my yoga studio as a cult, a certain image might come to mind. it's not a cult really, but there's something about it that's definitely cultish. cultesque, and that's something, it's language. the language some fitness studios use is striking. it's driven by ideology, ritual, even dogma. they promise a kind of belonging that isn't necessarily bad, but it is at the very least alternative. and it's not just yoga studios and crossfit gyms. there's cultishness in the places we work, the places we go for fun, and in our social media feeds. this kind of language is everywhere. each of us is constantly influenced by the very same language strategies that created notorious cults like jonestown, heavensgate, and cinon. cultishness has been around throughout human history, but it's different now, ramped up. if you ask me, today we're living in the most cultish era of all time. why? it's complicated. the modern world is chaotic. our systems are riddled with labor and wealth imbalances. ads and influencers are pushing us to consume more, while environmentalists warn us we should be consuming less. and the crushing pressure to self-brand online has made us so anxious that our cravings for validation have become insatiable. not speaking from experience or anything. in the past, during times of turmoil, many people found at least some comfort or guidance from traditional authority figures like church leaders, the government, news reporters, and medical providers. but here in the us over the last 50 years, our faith in institutions has been in steady decline. so much for comfort and guidance. meanwhile, in my friend group, we often joke about starting a commune to deal with housing costs. a compound just makes sense in this economy. are we joking, though?  music  these conundrums are all eerily familiar. they remind me a great deal of another time in history that i am very familiar with. they remind me of the world my dad craig grew up in in the 1960s. i was raised on my dad's stranger than fiction tales. stories of this remote stretch of land in california where kids didn't go to a real school and adults had to shave their heads if they broke a rule. stories about how his parents, seeking a life free from the obsession with work and wealth, took him and his halfsisters and joined a cult. this tale starts in 1969, a time of incredible socopolitical unrest in the united states. we're on the heels of the john f. kennedy assassination and civil rights movement were in the throws of the vietnam war. in the face of all this, in the 1960s and '7s, countercultural groups started springing up full of people seeking ways to thrive without relying on those systems. from woodstock era hippies and transcendental meditators to more sinister groups like the way international and scientology. it was so dramatic that some scholars refer to this period in the mid- 20th century as the fourth great awakening, grouping it together with other major religious transitions in american history. and here we find my dad or the person who would become my dad because craig was all of 14 when he moved with his family to cinon. cinanon was a community that started as an alternative drug rehab center but expanded to attract lifestylers like my grandparents. that was the word for so-called squares who didn't need rehab but still wanted in on this lifestyle experiment. best thing for people is people and cinon provides the environment to bring together peoples from all walks of life. cinon was the antidote to all the problems of the modern day. offering a template for who to be and how to live morally, sustainably, healthfully, which i get. it relieved some of that stress i mentioned at the start. it provided that missing comfort and guidance. and at its best, cinanon was saving people's lives. moving there was truly transformative for many, including talented artists and musicians who chose to trade their addictions for playing nightly tunes and getting high on nothing but group bonding. but from my dad's perspective, things in cinon were a little weird. like everyone dressed alike. overalls, short haircuts. it was actually pretty hip by today's standards. cult chic, compound casual. members used all kinds of special words and did mandatory rituals. but the thing that really freaked out my dad was how everyone was so obsessed with cinanon's visionary leader, chuck dedric, a normal guy who they treated as a man god. so my dad became a loner just trying to fly under the radar. as i grew up, i became fascinated by groups like this, wondering what drives the irrational and overly uniform beliefs within them. and i started to notice something. the same kind of language that cinanon used to recruit and isolate their followers. it was everywhere. this language can be found in our everyday lives, manipulating us even and especially in places we wouldn't expect.  music  but pause. before we get much deeper, we should figure out what the word cult even means. because on the surface, an exercise bike company and a sober compound in the hills don't have all that much in common. i've heard it said that cults are like porn. it's a joke that references a famous 1964 supreme court case where when asked for a definition of pornography, justice potter stewart said, ""i know it when i see it."" as soon as i say the word cult, you might picture a certain image of robes, a kind of dazed look, super long hair, dirty feet. but that's just a stereotype. the word cult hasn't always had sinister undertones at all. let's take a detour to the 17th century. the earliest written usage of cult traces back to the 1600s when the word meant homage paid to divinity or offerings to win over the gods. 200 years later, by the mid 1800s, cult evolved to mean a kind of churchly categorization, more like sect, used specifically to describe ancient or primitive systems of religious belief. the word conoted something unorthodox maybe, but not necessarily malignant. around this time, dozens of sociospiritual clicks were cropping up and fading in the us. polyamorous communists, egalitarian inventors, vegan farmers. there was basically a cult or sect for anyone. i mean, one of the reasons the us was founded was for religious freedom. and america had gained a reputation as the sort of place where you were free to get as socioposiritually freaky as you liked. it wasn't until the 1960s and 70s that the word cult started gaining a darker reputation. the mass emergence of non-conformist spiritual groups unsettled traditional christians. then came several high-profile cult related tragedies. the manson family murders of 1969 where celebrities and everyday people were killed in their homes. and the jonestown massacre of 1978 where over 900 people unwillingly took their lives under the influence of their leader. from there, the word cult was solidified as a national symbol of peril. what followed was a period in the 1980s known as the satanic panic when conspiracy theories about cults abusing suburban kids spread around the us like wildfire. here's what i find especially interesting, though. as soon as cult became synonymous with harm and infamy in the 70s, it also became kind of cool. that's why we have slang like cult following and cult classic to describe midnight showings of the rocky horror picture show or the followings of jam bands like the grateful dead. this wink wink hyperbolic interpretation of the word to describe devoted fan bases is why i can cheekily reference soul cycle as a cult brand or describe disney adults as culty. and you know i'm not talking about communes and death. at least hopefully not. which brings us back to the task at hand. i was supposed to be defining cult here but as you can see it's really hard. you understand how we get to i know it when i see it. because that's the thing about language. in everyday practice, definitions are determined not by academics or dictionary makers, but by us, the speakers. meaning depends on the person you're talking to and the context. like when cult is used to write off groups that mainstream society judges, folk magic practitioners, for example. there's more on that aspect of the term in crash course religions. but when it comes to sinister cults, it can be helpful to have a less vibes driven definition. a number of psychologists have developed rubrics for this. they include things like, does it have a charismatic and idol worshipped leader who offers validation and is the only source of truth and wisdom? is there abuse, including financial, sexual, and or labor exploitation? is there extreme paranoia about the outside world and no tolerance for questioning? is there meaningful financial transparency and is there a viable exit strategy? that's the checklist i tend to use personally and it comes in part from psychiatrist robert j. lifton and in part from the cult education institute. there's ongoing disagreement among scholars about what should go on these lists. but the point is when i say something is cultish, it usually checks off at least one of these boxes. the checklist can be applied broadly. like i can think of some celebrated hollywood clicks, silicon valley companies, and fitness studios that check some of these. and unfortunately, you won't find a major religion that doesn't check some of them either. but i see the world through a socio- linguistics lens. so for me, the most interesting connection here isn't that you can find abuses of power everywhere. it's that you can find the same type of language everywhere. strategic language that holds a lot of power and influence. society has changed since 1969 when my dad joined cinon and it's primed us to become the most cultish era ever.  music  but before we can get into the real cultine, we've got to understand what happened in the 1960s when my dad moved with my grandparents to cinon. it was a time of cultural turbulence and fear, not all that different from today. but this was also before the internet, before social media. to learn about cinanon, my grandfather had to get up, leave the house, and talk to people in person. contain your shock, jenzie. but in today's world, we're more isolated. in 2024, an american psychiatric association poll surveyed over 2,000 american adults and found that 30  had felt lonely every single week during the last year. so, how did this happen? according to a 2024 survey from harvard, participants reported being overworked, not seeing family enough, a lack of spiritual life, and the biggest culprit for loneliness is digital technology. let's be real, skimming through your friend's life updates isn't the same as catching up irl. add to all this the fact that we've basically got a tragedy on demand machine in our pocket at all times. a 2019 report from john's hopkins university looked at young people who spent more than 3 hours per day on social media, and it found that those people internalized problems more, making it harder to cope with depression and anxiety. so many of us are more disconnected than ever while also carrying the weight of the world in our pockets. it's like we've forgotten we're humans. we're all about community. it's part of how we managed to survive as a species for so long. and if we're not getting community in person, many will try to fill that relationship void some other way. cue the heavenly internet.   blessing us with the keys to find any kind of community we could ever want. in a way, that's beautiful. but when i say any kind of community, i mean any kind, including fanatical fringe groups with charismatic leaders who are paranoid about outsiders who think they have all the answers and whose beliefs are dangerous to question. unlike my grandfather, we don't have to leave our homes to subscribe to new ideologies. we can be profoundly influenced without even leaving the couch. today, most zealous fringe groups build a digital system of morality and community. and in lie of a physical meeting place, jargon gives them something to assemble around. i'll never forget when i first downloaded instagram in the summer of 2012. i was struck that the app called its account holders followers instead of friends or connections. it's like a cult platform. i remember saying, ""is it not encouraging everyone to build their own little cult?"" and while these platforms claim to make an effort to stop truly dangerous ideas and disinformation from spreading, those safety nets certainly don't catch everything. ultimately, algorithms tend to prioritize spicy content, whether or not it's true. in fact, one 2018 mit study found it takes true stories about six times longer than false ones to reach 1500 people on the app formerly known as twitter. why? because false information seems more novel, more exclusive, and wise, authentic in its outlandishness. here's an example of how this has worked. qanon, a disperate online group which has been linked to real world extremist violence. q anon involves a kind of spiderweb of different conspiracy theories, rituals, and buzzwords, all of which promise answers in these uncertain times. the most extreme of qanon's ideologies attest that an evil cabal of elites or satan worshipping child abusers secretly runs hollywood, the media, and the democratic party. and donald trump was divinely sent to save america and the world from this vast evil. q anon rose in fame and popularity not through in-person meetings but rather internet forums and social media posts. qanoners use a glossery of lofty, vague, and everchanging vocabulary like 5d consciousness and do the research in order to intrigue curious recruits who might not get on board with overtly violent language out of the gate. they also do this to avoid the surveillance of social media companies who might be on high alert for qanon threats and shut down accounts that use certain terminology. it's easy enough to dismiss online cults as not threatening in the real world, but the influence of groups like qanon has led to very real harm. for example, in 2016, a man radicalized online showed up at a pizza parlor in dc that was the center of a bogus conspiracy theory. it was spread on sites like 4chan, which became a major hub for kqanon. he opened fire in the restaurant and told police he was there to self-investigate the conspiracy theory. of course, kqanon is not the cult for everyone. but what about influencer fandoms, which seem positive at first, but end up taking over someone's whole value system? in today's world, many of us find ourselves in parasocial relationships where we feel like we have a special connection with someone we see online. and when someone makes us feel known and seen, especially if we're isolated from the people around us, that's a well doumented risk factor for falling prey to charismatic cult leaders. so in 2025, our ultimate cult leader may be father algorithm and comment sections are new compound. it's easier than ever to fall into nefarious ideas or get wrapped up in something cultish. and the really wild thing is the language tricks that cult leaders use, our brains are actually wired to fall for them.  music  so, what are those tricks and how do they work? enter the game. the most memorable of my dad's cinon stories had to do with something called the game. the game was the centerpiece of cinon life, and it was essentially a form of endurance training or group therapy where followers gathered around in so-called tribes and were invited to single out other members to verbally berate them. the game could be hostile and even traumatizing. and yet in cinanon language, it was described as something you played. and playing was required even for kids. it happened several nights a week and might involve, say, one member calling out another with whom they had personal beef and shouting at them for being lazy or spoiled. this was called a pull-up. then others were encouraged to join in on the vitriol, also known as backing the play. life in cinon was framed within two rhetorical categories, in the game and out of the game. and when you were in the game, nothing else in the world existed. after the game was finished, you were supposed to compartmentalize, move on with your daily cinon tasks as if you hadn't just been verbally maligned for 7 hours, you know. and people say, ""well, what is the cinon lifestyle?"" we all play the game here, the cinon game. and that the contrast between the game and the notame is what makes up the lifestyle. when i heard about all this, i was fascinated by the way cinanon used euphemisms and insidery buzzwords to reshape followers reality. it sent a shiver down my spine. my dad said that some members, like my grandfather, were actually addicted to it. in this way, the game kind of reminds me of when online comment sections get really heated. you know when people can't stop posting negative or conspiratorial comments, thinking they're calling someone out for some moral infraction, but really they're just aiming for clout and maybe catharsis. let me know what you think of that idea in the comments below. the cinon game was like that, but in real life. describing what it felt like to play the game at 14, my dad said, ""to me, the torrent of heated accusations felt like verbal carpet bombing. i wished i were invisible."" he felt constantly gaslit, trapped in the linguistic prison of the game. okay, buckle up. things are about to get nerdy. in linguistics, there's a concept known as the theory of performativity, which argues that language doesn't just describe or reflect our reality, it creates it. the idea here is that speech itself has the ability to cause measurable changes in the world. if that sounds a little hocus pocus, think about when a justice of the peace pronounces a couple married or when an umpire calls you're out. that's how that works, right? not really in the cult of sports. and in synonyon, that exclusive, heavily repeated jargon, including phrases like in the game and out of the game, plus all the charged verbiage wielded during the game itself, worked to create a new reality for followers. studies have shown that repeating words and phrases makes our beliefs stronger. this is a describable phenomenon. it's called the illusory truth effect. the illusory truth effect is one of many mental shortcuts that our brains used to make efficient decisions. and for most of human history before a time when misinformation could spread so fast and far online, the illusory truth effect worked well enough. like picture you're a hunter gatherer. you're not on blue sky, okay? if everyone in your community tells you the red berries in the swamp are poisonous, that's going to stick. it might even save your life when you're out foraging. and if that isn't true, at least it didn't hurt. the trouble is, our minds are still inclined to interpret any repeated phrases as reality. like, if you heard something repeatedly during the cinon game, even if it was cruel, even if it was untrue, it could easily start to feel like a fact. and if you wanted to question that, if you confided to a friend that actually you don't think the game is helpful, they might respond with the synonym phrase act as if. essentially, this was a cue to pretend you agree with the cult's rules until one day you sincerely do. you know that phrase, fake it till you make it? this was kind of like cinanon's version of that. but in cinon, act as if was rooted in the belief that anything invented by chuck dedrich had to be good because he was supremely wise. act as if is an example of a cult language technique called the thought terminating cliche. thought-terminating cliche was coined by psychiatrist robert j. lifton in 1961. and it describes a kind of zingy stack expression that's easy to memorize, easy to repeat, and at its worst is aimed at shutting down independent thinking, questioning, or push back. thought-terminating cliches combined with another linguistic strategy to keep chuck in power. loaded language, aka emotionally charged labels and buzzwords that meant something innocuous or nothing at all to outsiders, but could be used on followers to create an us versus them mentality or even make psychological threats. like, does the term splitty mean anything to you? probably not. but in cinon, that was the label used to describe those who'd left the group, the ultimate betrayal and cardinal sin. loaded buzzwords like these are hyper effective because they jive well with our brains tendency to form in-groups and outroups. and again, detecting social patterns like these has historically been really helpful for survival. but when a community's aims are more cerebral than foraging for food, relying on our crude us versus them instincts rather than critical thinking becomes a problem. but to people in cinon, this might not have felt nefarious at all. it may have even felt fun. in my experience talking to survivors, cultish language is often the first thing you pick up when you get involved with an in-group and the last thing you let go because it's organic, invisible, and seemingly commitment-free. remember learning pig latin on the playground as a kid? it was like a secret code, and it immediately made you feel like one of the cool kids, right? what's that? well, at least i thought they were cool. anyway, pig latin is pretty far from synonyon lingo. and so far, you might be thinking you've been able to escape the worst of cultish influence. trust me, i get it. i'd like to think i have, too. but it's not just infamous cult leaders who've caught on to this. in fact, this kind of manipulative language is sused into our everyday lives in ways we don't even notice.  music  introducing corporate jargon. you might not work at a company where people walk around saying things as ridiculous as we need to leverage our synergies to drive innovative solutions. or maybe you do, in which case, wo. but most companies have some kind of loaded language used to motivate people to work hard and help them feel like they're a part of the company mission. a business scholar named manfred frqued devise explained to me that in the workplace an excess use of slogans, code words, meaningless corporate jargon, and company chance can be a clue in distinguishing if an employer is treading into dangerously cultlike territory. in his words, quote, ""all companies have special terms, and sometimes they make sense, but sometimes they're nonsense."" as a consultant, i sometimes enter an organization where people use acronyms, but they don't actually know what they're talking about. they're just imitating what top management says. a famous example of this is amazon, a company whose ideals take classic american values like meritocracy, individual ambition, and climbing ladders, and institutionalizes them into what i interpret as a religious dogma of sorts. for example, amazon has its own version of the ten commandments, so to speak, called the leadership principles. they include high flulutent phrases like think big, dive deep, have backbone, and deliver results. according to the new york times, amazon encourages employees to memorize the principles when they're hired, then live and breathe them both in and outside the office, like biblical proverbs. some employees even teach them to their kids. ex amazon employee and writer christy coulter once told me that some employees misinterpret the leadership principles as a justification for asserting power over their co-workers. like using the disagree and commit principle as an excuse to pick fights or tear apart fellow employees pitches in meetings almost as a stunt to demonstrate their loyalty to amazon's mission. not terribly unlike the cinon game. in a society where work and consumerism are slowly replacing classical religious institutions as a system of belief and belonging, this kind of language is worth keeping an ear out for. an even more famous example comes from the multi-level marketing industry, aka mlms. this is tupperware. you can freeze it, stack it any which way. within pyramid-shaped mlms, recruits sell products like leggings or health supplements to their family and friends, in turn, luring these people to become sellers themselves. recruits are regarded as business owners, even though none of the traditional rules of entrepreneurship apply. mlm acolytes are labeled consultants or distributors. and the higher one moves at the structure, the more grandiose their titles become. director, executive, triple ground diamond, most distinguished mistress of linguistics. yeah, i can see why that's appealing. what's fascinating about mlms is that they're not actually selling financial independence in any concrete way. instead, they're selling something much more abstract and very american. optimism. faith that you can achieve the american dream, even if it's numerically impossible. and that promise is made with this sparkly language. imagine a note like this sliding into your dms from an old high school classmate. hey, girly pop. loving your posts lately. you have such an amazing energy. have you ever thought about turning that energy into your own business? i used to be miserable at my old 9 to5 and now i make a full-time living working part-time for myself from home without ever having to leave my little one's side. would love to grab coffee and tell you more. data shows that since the tupperware party days, mlms tend to target stay-at-home wives and mothers, as well as other demographics like college students and immigrant communities who are generally locked out of the dignified labor market and simultaneously seeking purpose. they also tend to have a strong base of friends and family to recruit from, lots of hope for the future, and at least some spare money and time that they'll likely never get back. even beyond work, similar strategies stretch into our niche interests, our fandoms. like, don't get me wrong, i love t-swift's red album. but it isn't lost on me that swifties have a robust glossery of fan lingo used to build community around their parasocial god. references like kalor and gaylers, the numbers 13 and 89, and phrases like not a lot going on at the moment are used to make fans feel part of a movement, to give them power, to show their real devotees above casual listeners, countless internet communities, from fantasy sports leagues to political forums, have loaded language of their own, too. and while it can be used to construct a positive sense of belonging, dftba, am i right? it can also create needless us versus them conflicts and shut down independent thought, especially if the people involved don't quite know why they're saying these chants and buzzwords that incite such strong emotions. that language tobrain connection is powerful. it can be used to bind someone to an in-group and make them feel like they can never leave. it can be used to confuse a follower so they start to believe the only way to know what's true and guarantee their safety is to depend on the all- knowing leader forever.  music  okay, so we've talked about what a cult is, how language is a cult leader's most powerful and sneakiest tool, and why modern society is so susceptible to these strategies. but there's still a question that haunts me. if cultishness shows up in the words we use every day, if we can hear it around us, then how is it still so effective? cultish language can actually be really hard to clock because it often evolves slowly. for example, sometimes cult leaders take existing english words that followers have been using their whole lives and gradually twist their meanings until they have a whole new definition that serves the cult. i once interviewed a survivor of the healthy, happy, holy organization or 3ho, a dogmatic condundalini yoga based group who told me that one common english term that meant something totally different to her group was old soul. to most of us, old soul describes someone who's wise beyond their years. it's a positive thing. but to a 3o member, the phrase was warped to mean someone who'd reincarnated life after life and could never get it right. it was threatening and it could be used to frighten followers into obedience because if you broke one of 3's rules, like by eating meat or failing to study scripture at a certain time, you'd be at risk of lowering your vibration and becoming an old soul. in different flavors and with varying aesthetics, this kind of language is used to coers people in all destructive cults. but people don't fall for things like this because they're foolish. in large part, it's because cult leaders are taking advantage of not just the power of language, but also a handful of vulnerabilities that have been hardwired into our heads since the days when we spent most of our time gathering nuts and berries. i see it like this. the brain is like an operating system. let's call it os human. in lots of ways, os human is really advanced these days. it can send a text message and open 250 browser tabs at the same time. not to brag, but in other ways, it's the same basic operating system we've been using since we started walking upright. for one thing, os human has a strong natural inclination toward communalism, loyalty to our own group, which we may view as superior to other groups. and this makes sense evolutionarily. the famous biologist charles darwin pointed out that for survival purposes, it's ideal to have a relatively small community. think about it. it's way easier to take care of a few dozen people than a few hundred or a few billion. but our world is much larger now. we're connected to way more people. and yet, os human hasn't completely updated. we still tend to be fiercely loyal to the insular groups we're a part of. even if they're virtual, even if they're not really our groups in any sense resembling what darwin was talking about. and here's the thing, that os human source code was built on some not so reliable foundations. this is due to cognitive biases, psychological tricks that developed in early human brains to help us make efficient decisions with our limited time, memory, and brain power. the illusory truth effect i mentioned earlier is one of them. another is confirmation bias. this is our tendency to only seek out, notice, and internalize information that validates what we already believe. confirmation bias can make it hard to accept or even notice new contradictory information. it allows us only to hear what we want to hear. and part of a cult leader's charisma is their ability to intuitit this. like going back to jonestown, one survivor named laura johnston cole once told me i was there for political reasons. so jim thought, ""every time i see laura sitting in a meeting, i have to address politics. i let him address my priorities and put blinders on for other things."" this is classic confirmation bias. one more major flaw in os human, the sunk cost fallacy. this is the belief that if you've already spent resources on something like money and time or even hope and secrets, you can't give that thing up. if you've already sunk 10 years and your life savings into a group that promised you transcendence, you're going to be heavily motivated to justify your choices to prove that any day now the time and hope you put in will pay off. sun cost fallacy plus thought terminating cliche. game over. that's the power of cultish language over an operating system full of cognitive biases.  music  so there are all these factors working against people getting out of cults. sometimes it can seem nearly impossible to escape. but there is reason for hope. here's the story of how my dad got out. when my dad was in high school, he was in the thick of it. he was surrounded by friends, family, teachers, doctors. everyone around him had so fully absorbed the language of cinanon that there was really no other language spoken. there was no education except cult education. cinanon kids were required to go to the school on site, which wasn't teaching multiplication tables or multiple perspectives. it was designed to keep them solidly imshed in cinanon culture. but craig was simultaneously learning to think in a different way by being exposed to science. he worked in the group's microbiology lab where he'd test followers for diseases because they wanted to avoid outside hospitals. in a way, the lab was his sanctuary. it was the one space in all of cinanon that was governed by questions and empirical facts. it gave him practice thinking critically and accessing a diversity of information. and as his interest in biology grew, he knew he'd need to go to college if he wanted to continue to learn. that meant he needed an accredited degree from an outside high school. so craig began hitching rides into san francisco to attend one against tradition and against the urging of people around him. according to chuck dedrich, cinanon was utopia and leaving it was a death sentence. but craig did it anyway. and with each passing day, the world of cinon felt more contrived and toxic. ultimately, when graduation came, the decision to leave was actually an easy one. in fact, he was desperate to go. so, against the pressure of everyone on the inside, he traded cinon for college, just in time to witness its downfall from afar. by the late 1970s, chuck's act as if protocols became harder to follow as his dogma grew more and more extreme. for example, some survivors say when chuck's doctor told him he needed to lose weight, chuck forced everyone else in the group to go on strict diets, too, coercing them to participate in humiliating mass weigh-ins in the nude. after chuck's wife passed away from cancer and he fell in love with someone new, he demanded that everyone else go through the same grief process as a personal growth exercise and he separated all the married couples in cinanon, then assign them new partners. that was the last straw for craig's dad and stepmother, and they finally left cinon in 1977. as time went on, chuck also became increasingly paranoid about outsiders. that inspired him to scrap one of his original cardinal rules, no violence. he instituted a personal militia called the imperial marines, who he mandated to physically beat splatizes, the traitorous defectors. this all culminated in one last act of violence. chuck instructed his army to place a rattlesnake in the mailbox of a lawyer representing splatizes. the snake bit the lawyer, landing him in the hospital, and chuck dedrich was arrested. though due to declining health, he never spent any time in jail. cinon disbanded shortly thereafter, though remnants of the game still live on in online communities and comment sections. as for my dad, he must have had one heck of a college essay because somehow he got into uc berkeley, graduated with a degree in bacteriology, then moved on to ucla where he earned his phd in microbiology. he went on to marry a fellow research scientist. hi, mom. and eventually became a professor.  music  so craig got out, but where does that leave the rest of us? we're living in an increasingly complex world teeming with petty problems, overwhelming choices, fractured communities, and a constant onslaught of both true and false information that our brains simply did not develop to handle. so, our cognitive biases sometimes tell us to double down on cultish choices, to stay with that candidate a little longer, to try a final month at that culty fitness studio to buy one more stanley cup. despite enormous evidence that we should reconsider, simply put, our once useful cognitive shortcuts are clashing with the modern world. as for why my dad didn't buy into so many of the cultish strategies that worked on his peers, well, in part, he had his interest in science to think for that. this just goes to show that even in highly oppressive environments, a hint of skepticism can point you toward hope. but short of running a microbiol, what are the rest of us supposed to do about this? what can we take away from my dad's story as people who are exposed to cultish language every day? well, i argue that being manipulated isn't always bad. anything can be taken too far. but as a whole, just because something is a little cultish doesn't mean you have to give it up. because here's the thing, human beings influence each other often times in irrational ways. it's what we do. we're a social and mystical species. and cultish language can be a way to mobilize people for good. like one of my best friends works at a cancer nonprofit and she's recruited me to do some fundraising for them. this is an objectively good mission that i believe in. but vying for research funding is hard and i've noticed how the mantras and labels used within this nonprofit to keep people inspired can be cultish. someday is today. you are the greatest generation of warriors and heroes in this quest for a cancer cure. am i being manipulated when i hear phrases like that? totally. but when it's safe, respectful, and easy to get out of when you've had enough. being a little irrational about the things we love together, well, that's a core part of being human. we chant at sports games, cry shouting the same phrases over and over again until we really do believe that our team is unbeatable. we wear special friendship bracelets to concerts and flash funny hand signs at each other to show we belong to communities we love. is it all a little mystical? sure. but that's how humans are. and admitting that might just be the key to making the best of our cultish proclivities without letting them take over our lives. i believe that we can strive to preserve the sanctity of facts without giving up the fun of ritual or the might of cultish language. for example, we can use what we know about the illusory truth effect to spread real facts. pretty fonts, rhyming

It long stood as a symbol of confinement and inescapable fate. But it's also a place of radical change. The site of perhaps the most important event in modern Native American history. More than a protest, it was a catalyst that helped bring the relationship between the American government and Native nations into a brand new era. One that we're still feeling the effects of today. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. In previous episodes, we covered a lot of friction between the US government and Native American peoples. There were broken treaties and forced removal to reservations, the attempted elimination of native cultures through assimulation and aotment, efforts to repair things that fell short like the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, and then sweeping reversals of previous agreements with the termination era. Things were pretty bad for like centuries. So by the 1960s, tensions were high between native nations and the US government. Native groups like the American Indian Movement and Red Power Movement had risen up to try to make change. Power to the people. And in November 1969, a group of Native Americans calling themselves Indians of all tribes took over and occupied Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay for 19 months. That's over a year and a half. Side note, Alcatraz Island was originally home to the Muewekma Aloney tribe for about 10,000 years before the Spanish discovered it. Richard Oaks, one of the group's leaders, said in a statement, ""The choice now lies with the leaders of the American government. To use violence upon us, as before, to remove us from our great spirits land, or to institute a real change in its dealing with the American Indian."" Basically, the ball is in your courts. And here's the thing, it worked. A year after the occupation began, then President Richard Nixon announced plans for a sweeping new policy for dealing with native nations. one that would return power to tribal authorities and reaffirm native sovereignty. It was time to enter our self-determination era. This period, which began in the late60s and continues to this day, is defined by Native American activism. Activism pushing for the honoring of previous treaties, more autonomy over how we're governed, and more control over resources on tribal lands. In other words, activism pushing for the ability to self-determine. Solid name. But before we dive into the good and bad of this new era of federal Indian policy, let's zoom out a little. For decades, the US government had entrusted itself with the welfare of native nations, a relationship that was established by treaties and policies and reinforced by Supreme Court cases. The bulk of that trust relationship was maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or BIA. But many Native nations had never stopped fighting for their inherent right to self-govern. And while protest movements like the occupation of Alcatraz helped to finally push policy forward, self-determination had been a goal of many tribal leaders for years. Like in the early 60s, the Zonyi nation of what's now New Mexico found a legal loophole that allowed them to take more control over critical community services typically handled by the BIA. By replacing federal employees with elected tribal leaders, the nation gained more say in its own governance. Nixon actually pointed to the success of the Zouri in his speech, calling for self-determination, saying, quote, ""The time has now come to build on these experiences and to extend local Indian control."" In 1975, Nixon's proposal became a reality through the Indian self-determination and education assistance act. And as of 2024, self-determination remains the driving policy behind US tribal relations. We determine ourselves. Thank you very much. But what does this actually mean for Native Americans? Basically, self-determination allows Native nations more control over social services like schools, first responders, and health care clinics. The federal government still maintains oversight, and the process is convoluted to say the least, but it's no longer fully in charge of these essential parts of tribal communities. The federal government is also required to consult with native nations anytime they plan to propose a policy that would directly involve them. Or take education. For over a hundred years, the government ran or outsourced Indian boarding schools that focused primarily on erasing native culture and absorbing natives into American culture, a process called assimilation. This was often accompanied by physical, sexual, and emotional violence. There's much more on this in episode 12. But in the era of self-determination, most tribes were able to take over governance of BIA run schools, radically altering the way native youth were taught. That meant ditching the old assimulation tactics and turning tribalrun schools into places of community and healing. For example, in what's now Oklahoma, the Riverside Indian School once forced native students to cut their hair and punish them for speaking their languages. Today, native students there are learning about their history and culture, participating in traditional dances and songs, and wearing customary clothing like moccasins and ribbon dresses. Some of the former students have even returned to serve as teachers, helping to undo the harm of the past. And while the school is still technically operated by the BIA, thanks to self-determination laws, its day-to-day operation is run by local native administrators and teachers. Core subjects are also being filtered through a native lens thanks to this new structure like using the teachings of UPIC elders in Alaska. Some schools have connected their math curriculum to cultural knowledge by teaching about geometry using a traditional salmon rack. By combining culture with context, students are able to better connect with abstract mathematical formulas. And many tribes are finding that teaching in native languages or using native cultural touchstones actually reinforces other areas of learning. At the Rockpoint chapter of the Navajo reservation in what's now northern Arizona, all classes are taught in the native language of Navajo. Children learn everything from math to grammar in the language of their ancestors. It's part of the recent effort to revitalize the Navajo language. And not only does it do wonders for the language itself, but researchers found that the students at Rockpoint scored higher in math compared to kids on other reservations. They even scored higher in English. Other steps were taken to protect native children during this period, too. Like in 1978, just a few years into the era of self-determination, Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act. This made it easier for a native child to be placed with a relative, tribal foster agency, or other member of their native nation. It was passed in response to a congressional investigation which found native children were removed from their homes at much higher rates than non-native children. Often they were placed with non-native families in non-native communities. And arguably, there's no better resource for native children than their families and tribes. Children raised by relatives are far more likely to live in a stable environment and more likely to be employed or in school by age 21 and they're less likely to be unhoused or incarcerated. But before you go thinking that the self-determination era is all glitter and roses, there have been and still are issues. Remember during the previous era of termination, lots of native nations lost their federal recognition, which meant the federal government ended the nationto-nation relationship they had with those tribes, which also meant they could no longer apply for funding and grants through the new policies. So, not every tribe gets to experience the positive effects of self-determination. And then there was corruption and fiscal mismanagement within the BIA itself. In the 1980s, George HW Bush's administration organized the Special Committee to Investigate American Indian Affairs. And in 1989, it released a report that found, quote, ""Fraud, corruption, and mismanagement were pervasive within the BIA as well as within tribal governments themselves."" In the intervening years, Congress passed a number of amendments to the original Indian self-determination law designed to address some of these issues. Passed in 1988, one amendment further protected the ability of tribes to contract and manage federal programs for themselves and to use funds as they deemed necessary. Other later amendments established tribal self-governance as a permanent program within the Department of Interior or DOI and the Department of Health and Human Services or DHS. These amendments gave tribal leaders more oversight in the way funds were actually being spent on tribal programs, which is what they should have had all along. So that brings us to today. It's now been over 50 years since native activists sailed into the waters of the San Francisco Bay and claimed an island prison as their own. In 2015, one of the original occupiers, Johnny Barub of the Cino and Sue Nations spoke at the 45th anniversary gathering. Alcatraz was the beginning. It was also giving permission to everybody in Indian country that it's okay. You can stand up for your rights. In the years that followed, plenty of natives heeded that call, pushing the US government toward a more just relationship with native nations. And that work is ongoing. For example, the National Association of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations consults with the US Department of Agriculture to advocate for better access to fresh and traditional foods. That includes increasing tribal control to source healthier options in the food packages serving native communities. Because here's the thing. Self-determination policies have done a lot for Native nations. They've given us more control over our tribal governments, allowed us to provide education to our youth through cultural contacts, and helped keep Native children with native families. But they haven't been a cure all. There are still unrecognized treaties, unseated lands, and legacies of injustice. But the good thing is there are still people willing to fight for a better world. And who knows, maybe in the years to come, we'll find another path forward and we'll enter a brand new era. In our next episode, we're going to explore some of the ways modern federal Indian policy impacts natives today. And I'll see you then.

It was 1952. The Monomin had just won a 16-year legal battle over the US government's mismanagement of their forest, and they had been promised $8.5 million. They now had control over how that forest was locked. And even though the average tribal member wasn't well off financially, the Monomony had a safety net, but it was about to break. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] Over the years, the US government's policies towards Native Nations have swung between marginally supporting their right to exist and trying to erase them. In episode 12, we covered the allotment and assimilation era when the US broke up native nations, split their lands, and tried to make native people live like white Americans. And in episode 13, we talked about the reorganization period when the government reversed course and tried to fix the terrible results of those earlier policies. But by the 1950s, the pendulum was swinging back the other way and federal Indian policies were about to enter a new era, the relocation and termination era. A period marked by pushes for new assimilation tactics or ways to absorb distinct cultures into a dominant culture. This of course had happened before and it would happen again. In the relocation and termination era, assimilation involved pushing natives to live and work in cities. That's the relocation part. At the same time, the government was terminating its nation to nation relationship with tribes. In other words, it no longer wanted to treat tribes as if they were their own sovereign nations with their own governments. And it wanted out of treaties. That's the termination part. We're getting to both in detail, but first I'll set the scene. In the wake of World War II, a debtstrapped US government was looking for ways to cut costs. That meant slashing budgets for federal programs. And policymakers soon zeroed in on the Bureau of Indian Affairs or BIA, the agency that funds basic services on or near reservations like schools, roads, and healthcare. Surely native folks didn't need funding for all that, right? Except there was a problem. The federal government had previously agreed to provide these services to native nations, agreements that dated back to treaties they'd signed in the 19th century in exchange for native land. That support was supposed to be permanent. But the government started to wonder, what if it wasn't? Hey guys, big idea came to me in a dream. Okay, listen. What if you all left reservations? All right, and then you moved to cities to live like white people, right? Then then and here's where it gets good. Then we the government can then tax and then sell your land to pay our own bills, right? I mean, it sounds absolutely incredible. And oh, listen. I got to go. I got to put a lot of things in jello. Okay. All right. You think about it. Let me know what you think. Okay. Love you. Bye. Enter the urban Indian Relocation Program of 1952, which through the BIA encouraged tribal members to move to major cities with the promise of good jobs. housing, education, free pizza. Okay, maybe not that last part, but you get the idea. And they offered government assistance in getting all of the above, minus the pizza. A few years later, the Indian Relocation Act even promised to pay for tribal members moving cost, job training, and health insurance if they relocated to cities. Sounds like a sweet deal, right? But it also meant Native Americans were leaving behind their communities and their cultures. Behind the glossy posters, relocation looked a lot like assimilation 2.0. The government hoped that native people would disappear by blending into the crowd, and so would native governments, reservations, the BIA, and the need to maintain those pesky treaties. Then in 1953, Congress passed part two, the Termination Act, which stated that Native Americans would be quote subject to the same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are applicable to other citizens of the United States, which sounds great to some people, even ahead of its time. But in practice, freedom meant the end of federally recognized sovereignty, the right to self-govern by breaking up native nations one by one, dissolving reservations, ending tribal governments, cutting off federal support. The logic was that if there is no native nations, there would be no responsibility to provide services to them. Now, some native organizations like the National Congress of American Indians saw right through this ruse and fiercely opposed the new policy. Instead, they proposed a government assistance program that could eventually return native nations to self- sustainability, which to be clear, native nations were self- sustainable before colonization, but after the wreckage we've seen in the last few episodes, some repair would be necessary. Unfortunately, despite widespread media coverage, this plan never went anywhere. And along with relocation, termination became the new dominant federal Indian policy. Which brings us back to the Monomony, one of the first native nations to be targeted for termination. Remember, they were thriving at the time. Their lumber mill was profitable. They had successfully sued the government for over $8 million. Unfortunately, it was because of this perceived success that the tribe was deemed ready to be cut loose. But before that could happen, the Monominee first had to agree to it. So in 1954, Senator Authur V. Watkins of Utah visited the tribe personally to persuade them. Well, maybe persuade is the wrong word. It was more of a bait and switch. See, tribal members had the opportunity to vote to get the settlement money they were owed. And by a show of hands, most people voted in favor. But Watkins had attached a provision that was essentially termination. And once it became clear that the vote meant the end of their government and reservation, it was too late. The actual process of termination proved to be a difficult and destructive task. Tribal property was transferred to a newly created corporation, Monomony Enterprises, Inc. with tribal members controlling a small stake in the company, and the reservation became Monomin County, which immediately made it one of the poorest and least populated in Wisconsin. Things quickly went from bad to worse. Without federal funds or a strong tax base to keep the lights on, the county's only hospital shut down. Many schools, utilities, and other basic services deteriorated. The new white superintendent of the lumber mill fired about 150 Monomony employees. Then the mill needed renovations that the Monomin couldn't afford. It was one thing after another, and within 7 years, the newly formed corporation was on the brink of bankruptcy. Many people sold their land just to stay afloat. The same story played out in 1958 with the termination of 44 tribes in California. Congress made promise to help those tribes improve roads, water, and sanitation before termination became official. But then it didn't keep those promises. I'm shocked. Shocked. And the state of California didn't help either, reasoning that this was the federal government's responsibility because, well, it was. Once again, many tribes were forced to sell or give up their lands, like the United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria. Their 40 acre holding dwindled to just 2.8 acres with a church and a park. All told, 109 nations were terminated during the 1950s and60s. This policy wiped away federal protections for 1.3 million acres of native land and it cut off 11,000 people or 3% of the American Indian population from the benefits of being recognized as citizens of their nation. No more tribal government, no more reservations, no more funding for basic services for their community. And termination only sped up relocation. As tribal members relocated to cities, fewer people were left on the reservations to fight termination. Then after termination, tribes had fewer resources to help their members. So more people moved to the city to try to make ends meet. Between 1950 and 1968, more than 200,000 Native Americans took up the federal government's offer of a one-way ticket to a city. Others moved on their own dime, but often the big promises didn't pan out. Instead, native folks commonly found scarce, low-end jobs, housing discrimination, racism, social isolation, homesickness. Many couldn't even afford a ticket back to the reservation. And for members of terminated tribes, the reservation no longer existed. For many, this was poverty with a change of scenery. We'll talk much more about relocation and its long-term effects in a future episode. But you know what else failed? The plan to disappear native nations and native people. We're still here and that's because of nativeled efforts. The Monominee weren't done yet. Technically, when the Monominee were terminated, the name Monomin Indian Tribe was terminated, too. But in 1962, they created a nonprofit organization just to preserve the name. Monomin Indian Tribe of Wisconsin Incorporated. Two years later, nearly 800 Monominees petitioned President Johnson to repeal termination. He did nothing. Then in 1970, a group called Drums, Determination of Rights and Unity for Monomin Stockholders, organized to get federal recognition back. Nobody had ever done that before until the group's leader, Adah Deer and James Washington Navatak devoted years of their lives to making it happen. And it worked. In 1973, nearly 20 years after termination, the Monomin tribe of Wisconsin was restored by an act of Congress. Deer went on to become the first woman to lead the Monomonye and later the first native women to lead the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1993, she said, quote, ""Against all odds, all odds, we invented a new policy, restoration."" Now, again, I would like to emphasize this. We, the Monomin, invented a new policy, restoration. This is the possibility. This is the challenge that indigenous peoples in the hemisphere and across the world can exert and accept. You don't have to accept the policies. You can work to change them. And that work hasn't stopped. For example, the Clamoth tribe, who lost federal recognition during the termination era, got it restored in 1986, though they didn't get back all of their former reservation lands. And despite federal termination, other tribes have gained recognition within their states, like the Gabina Tongba Indian tribe, one of two state recognized tribes in California. Still, many tribes terminated throughout the 1950s and60s remain without state or federal recognition in 2025, even though they fought for decades to get it back. Though they started as a way to cut cost for the federal government, relocation and termination served the same end goals. blend Native Americans into mainstream culture, break up Native nations, cut costs by getting out of the promises they made to them. They were new moves from an old playbook. Relocation separated natives from their cultures and communities while failing to uphold the promises of a better life, and termination was devastating for the nations affected, leaving scars felt to this day. And although many native nations fought hard to get their federal recognitions restored, many are still fighting. Next time, we'll talk about how the pendulum of federal Indian policy swung again and the dawn of a new era, self-determination. And I will see you then.

[Music]",the termination act explained  ep 14 of crash course native american history,"things were looking up for the monomin tribe of wisconsin, and that's exactly what made them a target. it was 1952. the monomin had just won a 16-year legal battle over the us government's mismanagement of their forest, and they had been promised  8.5 million. they now had control over how that forest was locked. and even though the average tribal member wasn't well off financially, the monomony had a safety net, but it was about to break. hi, i'm jay jim and welcome to crash course native american history.  music  over the years, the us government's policies towards native nations have swung between marginally supporting their right to exist and trying to erase them. in episode 12, we covered the allotment and assimilation era when the us broke up native nations, split their lands, and tried to make native people live like white americans. and in episode 13, we talked about the reorganization period when the government reversed course and tried to fix the terrible results of those earlier policies. but by the 1950s, the pendulum was swinging back the other way and federal indian policies were about to enter a new era, the relocation and termination era. a period marked by pushes for new assimilation tactics or ways to absorb distinct cultures into a dominant culture. this of course had happened before and it would happen again. in the relocation and termination era, assimilation involved pushing natives to live and work in cities. that's the relocation part. at the same time, the government was terminating its nation to nation relationship with tribes. in other words, it no longer wanted to treat tribes as if they were their own sovereign nations with their own governments. and it wanted out of treaties. that's the termination part. we're getting to both in detail, but first i'll set the scene. in the wake of world war ii, a debtstrapped us government was looking for ways to cut costs. that meant slashing budgets for federal programs. and policymakers soon zeroed in on the bureau of indian affairs or bia, the agency that funds basic services on or near reservations like schools, roads, and healthcare. surely native folks didn't need funding for all that, right? except there was a problem. the federal government had previously agreed to provide these services to native nations, agreements that dated back to treaties they'd signed in the 19th century in exchange for native land. that support was supposed to be permanent. but the government started to wonder, what if it wasn't? hey guys, big idea came to me in a dream. okay, listen. what if you all left reservations? all right, and then you moved to cities to live like white people, right? then then and here's where it gets good. then we the government can then tax and then sell your land to pay our own bills, right? i mean, it sounds absolutely incredible. and oh, listen. i got to go. i got to put a lot of things in jello. okay. all right. you think about it. let me know what you think. okay. love you. bye. enter the urban indian relocation program of 1952, which through the bia encouraged tribal members to move to major cities with the promise of good jobs. housing, education, free pizza. okay, maybe not that last part, but you get the idea. and they offered government assistance in getting all of the above, minus the pizza. a few years later, the indian relocation act even promised to pay for tribal members moving cost, job training, and health insurance if they relocated to cities. sounds like a sweet deal, right? but it also meant native americans were leaving behind their communities and their cultures. behind the glossy posters, relocation looked a lot like assimilation 2.0. the government hoped that native people would disappear by blending into the crowd, and so would native governments, reservations, the bia, and the need to maintain those pesky treaties. then in 1953, congress passed part two, the termination act, which stated that native americans would be quote subject to the same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are applicable to other citizens of the united states, which sounds great to some people, even ahead of its time. but in practice, freedom meant the end of federally recognized sovereignty, the right to self-govern by breaking up native nations one by one, dissolving reservations, ending tribal governments, cutting off federal support. the logic was that if there is no

In the early 1930s, millions of acres of Navajo land were at risk of erosion because of overg grazing by livestock. So, John Collier, the commissioner of the US Bureau of Indian Affairs, advocated for its conservation. Sounds like a solid ally move. Except it wasn't exactly. In a rush to save the land and use available government funds, he forced tribes to dramatically reduce their herds. In some cases, simply by slaughtering them and leaving them to the buzzards. This was a big deal. A Navo versus livestock was their food, income, and stability. And now it was destroyed. So, how can a plan with good intentions go so arai? Hi, I'm JJ and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] In our previous episode, we talked about what's known as the allotment period, which started in 1887 with the passing of the General Allotment Act, aka the Dolls Act. The law broke up reservations into smaller chunks of land given to individual native people. Their stated intentions were to give natives more control over their own land and to break up the tribes in the process. This legislation had a lot of negative consequences for native people and by the 1910s, white folks in government were starting to take notice. So 40 years after the aotment period began, Secretary of the Interior Hubert Work commissioned a report to assess the situation, putting US census statistician Lewis Miriam in charge. Now hold up, this was a huge deal. The US government had been abusing native peoples for hundreds of years at this point. And for the first time, they openly said, ""We might have done something wrong."" Which, yeah, understatement. But still, this was new for them. In 1928, Miriam presented his research group's findings from visiting nearly a 100 Native American reservations and interviewing about a thousand Native people. The survey, which came to be known as the Miriam Report, was more than 800 pages. That's like a whole George RR Martin book. Because it turns out there was a lot to say. The results were bad. Worse than 12th sequel in a horror franchise bad. The Dolls Act hadn't made things better for Native Americans. It had made just about everything way worse. Take finances. Instead of making natives more self-sufficient, a lotment caused a huge loss of income. In 1920, the average American was earning about $21,300 annually in today's money. But Native Americans were living off what today would just be over $1,500. And many natives who left their a lotments to find work in cities found so little support from white communities that they ended up living in shanty towns. And health care for natives had deteriorated too. For example, the survey looked at the Canton Insane Asylum for Indians and found that the food there was insufficient. Tuberculosis was spreading and there are so few trained workers that the people living there weren't getting the care they needed. The research team also found native education to be in dire straits. Native boarding schools were overcrowded and harsh punishments were common there. Native kids were being forced to do hard labor for hours every day while being malnourished. Forget learning, they were suffering. The Mir report shocked many in power. So, Congress funneled its recommendations into new legislation with the help of well-meaning ally of Navajo Lifestyle Reduction fame, John Collier. As commissioner of Indian affairs under FDR, Cullier held broker was often called the Indian New Deal and its centerpiece the Indian Reorganization Act passed by Congress in 1934. This was huge, bigger than the Super Bowl, the Aeros Tour and the finale of the Great British Bakeoff combined. This was the first piece of legislation that wasn't aimed at either assimilating or destroying Native Americans, but rather helping them. Major turning point in Native American history. check. The IRA's purpose was to throw down an UNO reverse card on the federal policy that had come before it. In the text of the law, the government recognized that tribes are qualified to exercise powers of self-government, not by virtue of any delegation of powers from the federal government, but rather by reason of their original tribal sovereignty, which is a lengthy way of saying tribes can rule themselves, not because the government says so, but because tribes say so. After decades of heavy government control, this was a major switcheroo for native tribes, and a good one at that. Along with reinstating tribal self-governing power, the IRA encouraged tribes to reorganize their governments by adopting their own constitutions and instating tribal councils to enforce them. The government also pledged to conserve indigenous lands and resources, lessen poverty through a new credit system, and end the practice of land aotment. Can we make some noise for the end of another terrible era? [Music] On the surface, this all seemed pretty great. But here's the tricky part. The IRA did pass, but only about 40% of eligible tribal members voted on whether to adopt it, meaning many tribes reorganized without all or even most of their members getting their voices heard. In the end, 160 plus tribes voted to reorganize under the IRA and adopted Americanstyle constitutions, and 77 tribes voted not to reorganize. But why didn't they want to govern themselves? To have more agency over their lives and their lands. Well, think back to the Navajo. Their pastoral lifestyle had been all but gutted by the same agency that was promising them a better future, even the same guy. Many Navajo weren't going to trust the people and institutions that had already hurt them. And some tribes had too much internal politics going on to focus on an IRA vote, while others didn't want to deal with more meddling from the federal government. Under the IRA, they'd have to get government approval for lots of things, from the wording of their new constitutions to their spending plans. But without that strict oversight, tribes could perform business as usual. So, what did it look like when a tribe did reorganize under the IRA? Let me tell you a story about the Ute tribes of Colorado. Collier needed some help persuading the Southern U and the Ute Mountain tribes to adopt the IRA. So, he enlisted the help of Sappia, the chief of the Mohash band of the Southern Ute tribe to convince them that the IRA was the way to go. Sappia was the poster child for the IRA's potential. He was a successful farmer and leader, and he managed to sway both tribes, or at least a few people who voted, to adopt the IRA. But he kept the secret to his financial success to himself. Preferential treatment from the government agencies. Conveniently left that part out. Hosapia. At first, things looked good for the Colorado youth. They were able to buy back 220,000 acres of their land that had been sold to non-natives. And not just any land. Land with coal, gas, and oil deposits. Hello, land leases. Hello, moola. Their communities were bouncing back. But something strange happened. The youths started to lose their culture. Think fewer tepeees, more picket fences, less traditional clothing, more jeans and cowboy boots. Fewer youth language speakers, more I only know English speakers. And losing your culture is no laughing matter. The disorientation many youths felt led to rising alcoholism and depression. So things were on the up and up, but at what cost? And that's the story of the Colorado Youths and the IRA. [Music] Many natives saw the changing governmental structures imposed by the IRA to be another kind of assimilation, a process where a minority group's culture gets absorbed or erased into a more dominant culture. Written constitutions and hierarchical governments allow the founding fathers didn't gel with the ways that tribal governments had historically functioned like the Ojiway tribe had previously operated through consensus where representatives from all villages had to agree before a measure was taken. But under the IRA things had to move more quickly to use funds before they laped for example and the majority ruled. On top of that, many native folks called the IRA the Indian RAW deal. For the way it kept a lot of power in the hands of the US government. New constitutions would require most actions the tribe took to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior and or the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and tribal councils had to adhere to the whims of the BIA whose leadership could change each election. But that's not all. The programs created by the IRA were also severely underfunded. And despite promises of restoring land, or at least paying for what had already been stolen, the federal government brought back only 2 million of the 90 million acres of land lost to European settlers and businesses during the allotment era. While land could no longer be taken by force from tribes, and the IRA added millions of acres to existing reservations, natives were still only given a small fraction of what they were owed. Maybe the main issue though was that the IRA was a single piece of legislation that was supposed to fix a whole host of different problems in really different tribes. Hundreds of years of broken treaties, land grabs, and punishing legislation took too high of a toll to be fixed by one law. But hey, it was Congress's first shot at rectifying those centuries of harms against Native Americans. No one gets it perfect right off the bat. You got to start an ongoing process of change, right? Right. Except here's the thing. Even with all the other legislation that had been created in the past century, the IRA is still in place. Let that sink in for a second. The first attempt made in 1934 is still the law of the land with all of its flaws and shortcomings. So where does that leave tribes today? In a lot of different places. The IRA still holds up its end of the bargain in some ways, like through providing funding and financial assistance and by supporting some native land use, even for a handful of tribes that didn't organize under the IRA back in the 30s. Which brings us back to the youths and the Navajo. The youths, who had lost some of their culture as a result of this policy, have been making strides to preserve it, establishing Ute Mountain ute tribal park, the Ute language project, and small bison herds on their reservations. And the Navajo, whose hurd were decimated to prevent erosion and voted not to adopt the IRA, are still debating the structure of their tribal government. Should it be locally focused or more centralized? Should they adopt a constitution or keep operating without one? The project of native government is never really over. 90 years later, Native Americans still debate whether the IRA was a success or a failure, and there are arguments that could be made for both. But perhaps the reason it's fallen short of its promise is that the promise was too big to be tackled in one go. Still, the IRA shows us how the process of repairing a relationship marred by hundreds of years of generational trauma can begin.

[Music]",the indian reorganization act explained  ep 13 of crash course native american history,"the land was dying. in the early 1930s, millions of acres of navajo land were at risk of erosion because of overg grazing by livestock. so, john collier, the commissioner of the us bureau of indian affairs, advocated for its conservation. sounds like a solid ally move. except it wasn't exactly. in a rush to save the land and use available government funds, he forced tribes to dramatically reduce their herds. in some cases, simply by slaughtering them and leaving them to the buzzards. this was a big deal. a navo versus livestock was their food, income, and stability. and now it was destroyed. so, how can a plan with good intentions go so arai? hi, i'm jj and welcome to crash course native american history.  music  in our previous episode, we talked about what's known as the allotment period, which started in 1887 with the passing of the general allotment act, aka the dolls act. the law broke up reservations into smaller chunks of land given to individual native people. their stated intentions were to give natives more control over their own land and to break up the tribes in the process. this legislation had a lot of negative consequences for native people and by the 1910s, white folks in government were starting to take notice. so 40 years after the aotment period began, secretary of the interior hubert work commissioned a report to assess the situation, putting us census statistician lewis miriam in charge. now hold up, this was a huge deal. the us government had been abusing native peoples for hundreds of years at this point. and for the first time, they openly said, ""we might have done something wrong."" which, yeah, understatement. but still, this was new for them. in 1928, miriam presented his research group's findings from visiting nearly a 100 native american reservations and interviewing about a thousand native people. the survey, which came to be known as the miriam report, was more than 800 pages. that's like a whole george rr martin book. because it turns out there was a lot to say. the results were bad. worse than 12th sequel in a horror franchise bad. the dolls act hadn't made things better for native americans. it had made just about everything way worse. take finances. instead of making natives more self-sufficient, a lotment caused a huge loss of income. in 1920, the average american was earning about  21,300 annually in today's money. but native americans were living off what today would just be over  1,500. and many natives who left their a lotments to find work in cities found so little support from white communities that they ended up living in shanty towns. and health care for natives had deteriorated too. for example, the survey looked at the canton insane asylum for indians and found that the food there was insufficient. tuberculosis was spreading and there are so few trained workers that the people living there weren't getting the care they needed. the research team also found native education to be in dire straits. native boarding schools were overcrowded and harsh punishments were common there. native kids were being forced to do hard labor for hours every day while being malnourished. forget learning, they were suffering. the mir report shocked many in power. so, congress funneled its recommendations into new legislation with the help of well-meaning ally of navajo lifestyle reduction fame, john collier. as commissioner of indian affairs under fdr, cullier held broker was often called the indian new deal and its centerpiece the indian reorganization act passed by congress in 1934. this was huge, bigger than the super bowl, the aeros tour and the finale of the great british bakeoff combined. this was the first piece of legislation that wasn't aimed at either assimilating or destroying native americans, but rather helping them. major turning point in native american history. check. the ira's purpose was to throw down an uno reverse card on the federal policy that had come before it. in the text of the law, the government recognized that tribes are qualified to exercise powers of self-government, not by virtue of any delegation of powers from the federal government, but rather by reason of their original tribal sovereignty, which is a lengthy way of saying tribes can rule themselves, not because the government says so, but because tribes say so. after decades of heavy government control, this was a major switcheroo for native tribes, and a good one at that. along with reinstating tribal self-governing power, the ira encouraged tribes to reorganize their governments by adopting their own constitutions and instating tribal councils to enforce them. the government also pledged to conserve indigenous lands and resources, lessen poverty through a new credit system, and end the practice of land aotment. can we make some noise for the end of another terrible era?  music  on the surface, this all seemed pretty great. but here's the tricky part. the ira did pass, but only about 40  of eligible tribal members voted on whether to adopt it, meaning many tribes reorganized without all or even most of their members getting their voices heard. in the end, 160 plus tribes voted to reorganize under the ira and adopted americanstyle constitutions, and 77 tribes voted not to reorganize. but why didn't they want to govern themselves? to have more agency over their lives and their lands. well, think back to the navajo. their pastoral lifestyle had been all but gutted by the same agency that was promising them a better future, even the same guy. many navajo weren't going to trust the people and institutions that had already hurt them. and some tribes had too much internal politics going on to focus on an ira vote, while others didn't want to deal with more meddling from the federal government. under the ira, they'd have to get government approval for lots of things, from the wording of their new constitutions to their spending plans. but without that strict oversight, tribes could perform business as usual. so, what did it look like when a tribe did reorganize under the ira? let me tell you a story about the ute tribes of colorado. collier needed some help persuading the southern u and the ute mountain tribes to adopt the ira. so, he enlisted the help of sappia, the chief of the mohash band of the southern ute tribe to convince them that the ira was the way to go. sappia was the poster child for the ira's potential. he was a successful farmer and leader, and he managed to sway both tribes, or at least a few people who voted, to adopt the ira. but he kept the secret to his financial success to himself. preferential treatment from the government agencies. conveniently left that part out. hosapia. at first, things looked good for the colorado youth. they were able to buy back 220,000 acres of their land that had been sold to non-natives. and not just any land. land with coal, gas, and oil deposits. hello, land leases. hello, moola. their communities were bouncing back. but something strange happened. the youths started to lose their culture. think fewer tepeees, more picket fences, less traditional clothing, more jeans and cowboy boots. fewer youth language speakers, more i only know english speakers. and losing your culture is no laughing matter. the disorientation many youths felt led to rising alcoholism and depression. so things were on the up and up, but at what cost? and that's the story of the colorado youths and the ira.  music  many natives saw the changing governmental structures imposed by the ira to be another kind of assimilation, a process where a minority group's culture gets absorbed or erased into a more dominant culture. written constitutions and hierarchical governments allow the founding fathers didn't gel with the ways that tribal governments had historically functioned like the ojiway tribe had previously operated through consensus where representatives from all villages had to agree before a measure was taken. but under the ira things had to move more quickly to use funds before they laped for example and the majority ruled. on top of that, many native folks called the ira the indian raw deal. for the way it kept a lot of power in the hands of the us government. new constitutions would require most actions the tribe took to be approved by the secretary of the interior and or the commissioner of indian affairs and tribal councils had to adhere to the whims of the bia whose leadership could change each election. but that's not all. the programs created by the ira were also severely underfunded. and despite promises of restoring land, or at least paying for what had already been stolen, the federal government brought back only 2 million of the 90 million acres of land lost to european settlers and businesses during the allotment era. while land could no longer be taken by force from tribes, and the ira added millions of acres to existing reservations, natives were still only given a small fraction of what they were owed. maybe the main issue though was that the ira was a single piece of legislation that was supposed to fix a whole host of different problems in really different tribes. hundreds of years of broken treaties, land grabs, and punishing legislation took too high of a toll to be fixed by one law. but hey, it was congress's first shot at rectifying those centuries of harms against native americans. no one gets it perfect right off the bat. you got to start an ongoing process of change, right? right. except here's the thing. even with all the other legislation that had been created in the past century, the ira is still in place. let that sink in for a second. the first attempt made in 1934 is still the law of the land with all of its flaws and shortcomings. so where does that leave tribes today? in a lot of different places. the ira still holds up its end of the bargain in some ways, like through providing funding and financial assistance and by supporting some native land use, even for a handful of tribes that didn't organize under the ira back in the 30s. which brings us back to the youths and the navajo. the youths, who had lost some of their culture as a result of this policy, have been making strides to preserve it, establishing ute mountain ute tribal park, the ute language project, and small bison herds on their reservations. and the navajo, whose hurd were decimated to prevent erosion and voted not to adopt the ira, are still debating the structure of their tribal government. should it be locally focused or more centralized? should they adopt a constitution or keep operating without one? the project of native government is never really over. 90 years later, native americans still debate whether the ira was a success or a failure, and there are arguments that could be made for both. but perhaps the reason it's fallen short of its promise is that the promise was too big to be tackled in one go. still, the ira shows us how the process of repairing a relationship marred by hundreds of years of generational trauma can begin. notice a problem, observe and talk to folks who are dealing with it, and bring that knowledge onto actionable change. it's tough, and it won't be perfect, but it's a start. in our next episode, we're going to discuss native american relocation and tribal termination, and i will see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course, native american history, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis, indiana, and was made with the help of all these nice people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone forever, you can join our community on patreon.  music",11654,1996

But the federal government has never never formally apologized until today. I formally apologized as president of the United States of America. He apologized for a federal policy that had forcibly separated Native American children from their families and into boarding schools for more than 150 years. The reception was mixed. While some native people have expressed belief that this history is being formally acknowledged, others had pushed for more. Rosalie Whirlwind Soldier of the Rosebudsue tribe told the Associated Press, ""Sorry is not enough. A whole generation of people and our future was destroyed for us."" I'm Shay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] It's 1883. After generations of broken treaties, wars, and forced removal, things are as bad as they've ever been for Native Americans. And white progressives calling themselves friends of the Indian are meeting to talk about how to make things right. At first, the friends talk about things like honoring treaties and restoring stolen land. But within a few years, they've pivoted. What if Native Americans just lived like settlers? As bad as things already were, they were about to get a whole lot worse. See, for about a hundred years, the US government had used a whole bag of tricks to deal with the fact that native people a existed and b controlled lands that settlers wanted. This was a so-called Indian problem, which isn't a joke. That's literally what they called it. But by the late 19th century, the government had exhausted most of its playbook. Sign treaties with native nations as equals, check. Break those treaties, check. Wage war, check. Remove tribes onto reservations. Check. In short, they had tried everything to solve the Indian problem. Well, almost everything. There's still one more play. A real Hail Mary. What if they turn Native Americans into white Americans? You know the old saying, if you can't beat them, make them join you. So, that's when Friends of the Indian began talking about assimilation, absorting natives into American culture. Conveniently, it suited the US government's goals. If native people lived and thought just like settlers, there would be no problem with using the land for all it was worth. And as the idea caught on, some people saw it as a way to help natives by quote civilizing them. Richard Henry Pratt put it this way. Kill the Indian, save the man. Pratt was a US Army officer who first started erasing native identity by forcing native prisoners of war to cut their hair, wear uniforms, and give up everything from their culture. When he later founded the Carile Indian Industrial School in 1879, he used the same methods on native children. Carlo was the first federallyun off-reservation boarding school for natives. And between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it became the model for dozens of other boarding schools supported by the US government. Thousands of native children were taken from their families, brought to schools hundreds of miles from home and forced to give up everything from their cultures, their clothing, their languages, their religion, even their names. Those who define the rules were beaten. Many suffered malnutrition, disease, and abuse. Luther Standing Bear in Ogla Lakota who attended Carlile remembers, ""We went to school to copy, to imitate, not to exchange languages and ideas, and not to develop the best traits that had come out of uncountable experiences of hundreds and thousands of years living upon this continent. Hundreds of native children died at these schools, and the ones who made it out would return to the homes and cultures they no longer felt connected to. A few native parents willingly enrolled their kids, hoping for the best. But many were forced. Some schools even required that parents give up custody entirely. There was resistance, of course, like the 19 Hobie men who were incarcerated at Fort Alcatraz in 1894 for refusing to send their kids to boarding schools. Plenty of others spoke out against the harms of boarding school, like the Yankton Sue writer Zin Kaliska, who shared her experiences working as a music teacher at Carlilele. In the Atlantic, she wrote, ""Gazing upon the Indian girls and boys bending over their books, the white visitors walked out of the schoolhouse wells satisfied. They were educating the children of the red man. But few had paused to question whether real life or long-lasting death lies beneath the semblance of civilization."" Pratt dismissed her writing as trash and fired her for speaking out. Despite all this effort, boarding school still had a problem. They only assimilated kids. What about the adults? Senator Henry Dolls, a member of the Friends of the Indian, had an answer. He believed that the key to assimilation lay in land ownership. If the government could control which natives owned what land and how that land was used, then assimilation would finally be locked in. So in 1887, Dolls and another friend of the Indian, anthropologist Alice Cunningham Fletcher, co-drafted the General Allotment Act, aka the Dolls Act. It authorized the president to chop up reservations into parcels up to 160 acres called aotments that were given to individual tribal members. Instead of a big chunk of land shared by the whole tribe, each member would get a small slice that belongs just to them. It's giving grift aotment was supposed to be the government's golden ticket, a fast track to assimilation. It would split up tribes and open up more land to settlers. Native men would farm. Native women would keep the house. And the Indian problem would finally go away for good. And to sweeten the deal, US citizenship for anyone who accepts an aotment and relinquishes tribal citizenship. No need to identify with a tribe when you're a citizen of the good old US of A. Allotment wasn't a new assimilation technique, though. In fact, it had already happened to the Omaha nation by the time the Dolls Act was signed. Just a year before their reservation was broken up, the Omaha's principal chief Angonga aka Big Elk wrote to his people, quote, ""I bring you news which it saddens my heart to think of. There is a coming flood which will soon reach us, and I advise you to prepare for it."" He had foreseen not just a collapse of the Omaha way of life, but a disaster that would wipe away native identity everywhere. As the government forced aotments onto tribes across the country, Big Elk's vision became a reality. Some tribes resisted at first. The Yankton Sue, for example, knew their land wasn't good for crops and wanted to keep it all for communal grazing. But federal officials use military force to persuade members of the tribe to take aotments. Many tribal leaders feared they'd just lose more of their land to settlers after the Dolls Act. And they were right. The government marked any non-allotted land as surplus to Indian needs and open it up for non-native settlers to purchase. Before the doll's act, native nations controlled 138 million acres of land. By the time aotment ended in 1934, they'd lost 2thirds of that acreage. The doll's act also led to the creation of tribal roles, list of every member of a tribe. The roles came with their own problems, including the creation of blood quantum, a way of measuring tribal membership by fraction of tribal blood, which was basically just an unscientific vibe check based on whether someone looked native. You can learn a lot more about that in episode 4. Tribal members assumed to be mixed race were assigned lower blood quantum and given US citizenship and full control of their aotment right away. But those assigned a higher blood quantum were presumed to be incompetent because they had no European blood. Basically, they weren't white enough. They were given a 25-year waiting period before they could take full control. And when they finally received the complete title to their allotment, many had to turn around and sell it because they couldn't afford to pay the property taxes. Yeah, big grift vibes from the dolls act. Thanks to the practice of aotment, many reservations today are a checkerboard of mixed ownership. Parcels owned by the tribe and tribal members are all jumbled together with parcels that aren't. For example, the Nez Purse reservation stretches across 785,000 acres, but only 13% of it is owned by the tribe or tribal members, which makes it hard to do anything that requires large connected chunks of land like farming and ranching or for tribes to carry out traditional activities. The effects of assimilation and aotment can't be understated, and they're still being felt generations later. Aotment left a legacy of land ownership that was at best fractured. After the death of those natives who could pay the property taxes, ownership was split up among their kids and their kids' kids and their kids' kids' kids and so on. So today, many aotments have hundreds of owners and the legacy of boarding schools is still being reckoned with. Dr. Denise Lashadier, a poet and enrolled citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chipoa, called the policies of that era cultural genocide. Many of her relatives, including her parents, spent time in boarding schools. She wrote about their experiences, saying, ""Speaking their tribal language was forbidden. My father talked about li soap being put in mouths, which caused painful blisters, and pins put through tongues."" But there is healing to be found. Survivors of boarding schools have told lies that language is medicine and culture is treatment. The more these practices are revived, the more healing can happen. And those efforts are underway across tribal nations. Like in recent decades, many native nations have begun to teach their traditional languages within tribalrun school systems, a far cry from the boarding school era. We'll talk much more about these efforts in a later episode. By the late 19th century, native nations had already seen generations of bad deals, broken promises, and loss of land and life. And in the era of assimilation and aotment, greed came disguised as a helping hand. Be like us, dress like us, work like us, speak like us, worship like us, and then things will be better. Despite native resistance, these policies brought catastrophic losses of culture and land, leaving scars that are still felt generations later. But today, tribes are fighting to reclaim their cultural identities, revive their languages, and heal generations of trauma. Next time, we'll talk about what happened in 1934 when the US government tried to put power back in the trib's hand. And I will see you then.

785,000 acres, but only 13  of it is owned by the tribe or tribal members, which makes it hard to do anything that requires large connected chunks of land like farming and ranching or for tribes to carry out traditional activities. the effects of assimilation and aotment can't be understated, and they're still being felt generations later. aotment left a legacy of land ownership that was at best fractured. after the death of those natives who could pay the property taxes, ownership was split up among their kids and their kids' kids and their kids' kids' kids and so on. so today, many aotments have hundreds of owners and the legacy of boarding schools is still being reckoned with. dr. denise lashadier, a poet and enrolled citizen of the turtle mountain band of chipoa, called the policies of that era cultural genocide. many of her relatives, including her parents, spent time in boarding schools. she wrote about their experiences, saying, ""speaking their tribal language was forbidden. my father talked about li soap being put in mouths, which caused painful blisters, and pins put through tongues."" but there is healing to be found. survivors of boarding schools have told lies that language is medicine and culture is treatment. the more these practices are revived, the more healing can happen. and those efforts are underway across tribal nations. like in recent decades, many native nations have begun to teach their traditional languages within tribalrun school systems, a far cry from the boarding school era. we'll talk much more about these efforts in a later episode. by the late 19th century, native nations had already seen generations of bad deals, broken promises, and loss of land and life. and in the era of assimilation and aotment, greed came disguised as a helping hand. be like us, dress like us, work like us, speak like us, worship like us, and then things will be better. despite native resistance, these policies brought catastrophic losses of culture and land, leaving scars that are still felt generations later. but today, tribes are fighting to reclaim their cultural identities, revive their languages, and heal generations of trauma. next time, we'll talk about what happened in 1934 when the us government tried to put power back in the trib's hand. and i will see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course native american

",US,16800000,1661,2025-08-05,2025,668,11.133333333333333,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyF8SOSP2YM,"In 1973, 200 indigenous protesters staged an armed takeover of Wounded Knee, where the US military had massacred 300 Lakota less than a hundred years earlier. They held the site for 71 days, exchanging gunfire with federal authorities, who later admitting to firing over half a million rounds at tribal members, killing two native men. And while most remembered the occupation for its violence, the protesters also held ceremonial dances, songs, and prayers and gained a lot of attention for their cause. But what were they fighting for? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] The occupation of Wounded Knee was broadly about treaties, formal agreements, usually between two or more states or nations. Many of the protesters were members of the American Indian Movement, which among other things fought for the US government to honor its treaty obligations with native nations. See, between the mid 18th and mid-1 19th centuries, a period called the treaty era, the US entered into nearly 400 treaties with Indian nations. And it wasn't a fun Taylor Swift kind of era. Most tribes were coerced into signing these treaties. And the few that entered willingly often did so without full understanding of their meaning. Treaties change tribal borders in major ways during this period. and played a huge part in removing Native Americans from their lands as colonists pushed westward. And when treaties didn't work in their favor, the US government often just disregarded them. And trust me, they ignored a lot. During this period, we also saw the formation and scaling up of reservations. These were specific portions of lands that the US government allocated to tribes, often forcing them to move there. We call the period between 1850 and 1887 the reservation area. But to understand how we ever got here to this point and to the occupation a hundred years later, we have to look backwards. So, I'm going to walk you through that hundredish year timeline, which means I'm about to cover a lot of history in a short amount of time. Think of this as a primer, a little appetizer. Don't make me say it crash course. So, when you finish this video, you might want to dig deeper. Actually, you should want to dig a little deeper. you will dig deeper. Let's start back in the olden times, 1626, when the indigenous Lape people of what's now New York, sold the island of Manhattan, then called Manahhata, to the Dutch for $24 worth of beads and other trinkets. Or at least that's probably the story you heard. It's been retold in textbooks and paintings, and it's even been cited as one of the foundational myths of New York City. I hear it's engraved on the Statue of Liberty right under I'm walking here. But this story has likely been exaggerated. Our records of the deal come from the writings of one lone Dutch dude who wasn't even there when it happened. The fact is it's possible that a band of Lape did sell the island to the Dutch for about $1,000. But the terms of the agreement were influenced by each party having very different worldviews. The Dutch, like most Europeans, thought of land ownership as something tangible and permanent. But many native nations, including some clans among the Lape, had a very different viewpoint. In their culture, land was controlled by the community and divided for use among extended family, which was different from the individual system of ownership Europeans were used to. Anyway, the Lape likely believed that they were renting or leasing the land, not selling it outright. Joanna Gorlick from the Museum of the American Indian put it this way. I don't think the exchange itself is in question. I think the meaning of that exchange is in question. This is just one early example, but these cultural misunderstandings and some intentionally fine print would play a large role in the treaty era. As more and more colonists came to the so-called new world, they pushed Native Americans westward, often violently, and tribes would understandably retaliate against the colonists who used their land and stole their resources. But during and after the American Revolution, especially when the Young Republic was weakened by its war with Britain, the threat of conflict with Native Americans was threatening. So many treaties at this time were focused on peace and friendship in exchange for land. In fact, the very first treaty called the Treaty with the Delawares was signed during the revolution in 1778 between the newly formed United States and the Lape who the Americans called the Delaware. It promised sovereignty and statehood in exchange for, among other things, letting American troops pass through their land unscathed during battles with the Brits. But although the Lape held up their end of the bargain, the US failed to deliver on theirs. This pattern would unfortunately repeat itself many times over. In the words of Lakota leader Redcloud, they made us many promises, more than I can remember, but they never kept but one. They promised to take our land, and they took it. As the US continued to grow, these treaties became less about keeping the peace and more explicitly about gaining territory. Some tribes signed away their lands either willingly or unwillingly, but many resisted, including the Cherokee, Creek, Chalkaw, Chickasaw, and Seol nations in the southeast. In this region, colonists saw the tribes as a roadblock to fertile land for growing cotton. In 1814, future President Andrew Jackson, then a major general in the army, led a push against the Creek Nation. It came to a head in the Battle of Horseshoe Ben near what's now the Georgia Alabama border. Many of the Creek were massacred, and the remaining were forced to sign a treaty that seated over 20 million acres to the US, which was a wake-up call for many tribes. Realizing it would be nearly impossible to defeat the Americans in battle, many chose to sign treaties that gave up much of their land in the hopes that they would at least get to keep some of it. But in 1830, a year after Jackson was elected president, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which gave the US government sweeping power to grant land west of the Mississippi River to any native nation that agreed to give up their land in the east. These treaties were officially considered voluntary, but in practice that was far from the truth as bribery and threats were commonplace. Consider the treaty of Newota, which Jackson signed with the backing of a single Cherokee chief who represented barely a fraction of the tribe. It gave the US 7 million acres of land in exchange for just $5 million. Unsurprisingly, many Cherokee didn't want to leave their ancestral homeland. So, under the leadership of principal Chief John Ross, they held out against removal. Ross and his supporters argued the treaty was a fraud and worked to convince the government to recognize the older treaties it had signed, guaranteeing the Cherokee the land they were already on. Ultimately though, the resistance broke down in 1838 when the remaining Cherokee were finally removed at gunpoint by the army and members of the Georgia militia. From there, Ross led his people westward as part of what would become known as the Trail of Tears. All told, during the 1830s, an estimated 100,000 Native American people were forced to leave their homes and journey thousands of miles west, and around 15,000 individuals died along the way. But it didn't end there. As the US continued to expand westward, the government began re-encountering the same peoples they had driven from the east a few decades earlier, not to mention those western tribes who had already lived there. I mean, what did they expect? But this time, the government took a different approach. What if instead of signing a bunch of treaties, they just reserved a small piece of land for tribes to live on? It had been done before with some success in 1786 when the United States established its first reservation. So, in 1851, Congress passed the Appropriation Bill for Indian Affairs, which allocated funds to build a more robust reservation system, kicking off the reservation era. Over the next 30 something years, most Native Americans were either forcibly relocated or saw their land dramatically reduced. And in 1871, Congress officially took away the right of native nations to enter into treaties with the United States government. It was an unceremonious amendment attached to an appropriations act passed without the input of any tribal members, and it was officially the end of the treaty era. But what did this mean for the nearly 400 treaties that had been made in the last century? Technically, they remained intact, but this decision made it even harder for them to be enforced, which brings us back to Wounded Knee. See, in 1868, the Lakota Sue signed a treaty with the US that established a great Sue reservation on 60 million acres of land. But not long after, the US government discovered a lot of natural resources on that land and decided to do some classic takes back seis. By the end of the reservation era, only about 20% of the original reservation remained with the rest back in the hands of the federal government. On top of that, reservation life was difficult for the Lakota. Drought combined with a lotments that were bad for sustainable crop growth made farming difficult. And both a near extinction of the buffalo population and rules against hunting on reservation land made their traditional way of life nearly impossible to sustain. So they had no choice but to rely on government rations. They were also disconnected from their culture and identity, forced to wear western clothing and abandoned their traditional spiritual practices in favor of Christianity. We're talk more about life on reservations in a future episode. By 1890, after a series of conflicts in the murder of Lakota Chief Sittingbull, tensions between the tribe and the government had reached a breaking point. US forces surrounded a mini Konju Lakota camp near Wounded Knee Creek where after a gun went off accidentally, the military massacred upwards of 300 Lakota men, women, and children. 83 years later, the occupation of Wounded Knee brought this massacre back into the public eye. Many scholars point to the occupation as the spark that kicked off a massive push for recognition of native treaty rights all across the country. After all, those hundreds of treaties are still the law of their land, whether or not they're honored. So, invoking them had become a major strategy for native nations to push for the return of their lands. And since the occupation, a number of them have used historic treaties to fight for and achieve legal wins. I know all this can feel like the distant past, but it's not. Babies born on the day of the Wounded Knee Massacre would have been in their early 80s during the occupation. And occupiers from 1973 joined protests at Stand Iraq to object to Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016. The point is the fight for treaty recognition continues right here, right now. Native leaders and activists continue to push the federal government to honor its promises and momentum only continues to build as new generations join the fight. Next time we'll talk about Native American assimilation and the aotment era and I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-07-29,2025,729,12.15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIJwt3zO4fw,"Okay, so let me tell you about Christopher Columbus. So I've been told you can't say any of that on YouTube. So let's start here with the Tyeno people. They're one of the first tribes to encounter Columbus in what's now the Dominican Republic in Haiti. Some scholars estimate that there may have been more than 3 million Tyenos in Hispanola when Columbus came ashore, but within a century they were declared extinct. A whole people gone. except they're very much still here. This historical inaccuracy isn't the only one in the story of the so-called New World. Far from it. Hi, I'm Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American history. [Music] Today we're talking about the first contact between Native Americans and European colonists. The story that's often told through this little diddy about 1492, the ocean blue, and you know who. First contact is a phrase used to describe the first meeting between two communities. And to say that there are a lot of misconceptions around the first contact between Native Americans and Europeans would be like saying Messi is good at soccer. Major understatement. You can feel the Ninia, the PA, and the Santa Maria with all that misinformation. So, let's start off with a quick fact check. The only thing Columbus set out to discover was a better way to get from Spain to Asia. The trade route known as the Silk Road was something of a shle between Europe and Central Asia, and the Ottoman Empire shut it down in 1453, prompting the so-called Age of Discovery. So, Columbus proposed a mathematically incorrect plan to sail west across the Atlantic. He got funding from the king and queen of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, who were pretty psyched for all the potential riches and the opportunity to spread Catholicism around the globe. Columbus and his crew made landfall in 1492 in what's now the Bahamas and he claimed for Spain what he believed to be India. Big colonizer energy. The Bahamas were home to the Lucayans, a branch of the Arawak tribe. Columbus immediately took six Lucayans as slaves or servants in his words. So yeah, we got some serious myth busting to do. [Music] In the Americas, the idea of first contact is described like this. Columbus shows up in the Bahamas and boom, Europeans have met Native Americans. But because neither Europeans nor Native Americans are just one thing, Columbus was only the first contact between the Spanish Empire and the Lucayans. There were countless initial means between Europeans and Native Americans both before and after Columbus got lost. Like there's evidence that more than 500 years before Columbus, the Scandinavian Vikings came to Greenland where they encountered the native Tuli people. And there were first contacts in Alaska and Hawaii, too, which we'll get into at a later episode. First contacts between different Europeans and native nations continued occurring all the way through the 1800s. The first encounter the sailors had with non-natives wasn't until 1805 when the Louiswis and Clark expedition wandered into their territory in Montana looking for horses and directions. So first contact is kind of a misnomer as is the idea of discovery. I mean Columbus has been celebrated for centuries for discovering a continent that millions of people already lived on. Fresh untamed wilderness. I shall call it Hey. Hey buddy. We're kind of filming here. This is our studio. Studopous. A name that just came to me in a divine vision with no outside influence. Again, already here. But you know what? Never mind. I'm going to get a holiday named after me for this one. Someone tell the Pope. So, if you've ever wondered how colonizers got away with just showing up to someone's home or studio and claiming it as their own, you can thank the popes. In 1493, Pope Alexander V 6th made a decree, also known as the Papal Bull, that any land not inhabited by Christians could be discovered and claimed by Christian rulers. Interetra was the third in a trilogy of paple bulls that made up what's called the doctrine of discovery. And this became the legal basis for Europeans claims over indigenous lands and later Americans justification for westward expansion. You know the old saying, paper bulls gives you wings. The point is this defense held up in court as recently as 2005 and its impacts had been felt by indigenous peoples all over the world for centuries. We'll circle back to sketchy land grabs in a bit. But regardless of first, second, and thousandth contact, one thing's for sure, European arrival was catastrophic for Native American populations. While exact numbers are hard to pin down because of fragmented historical evidence, the overall population may have been decreased by as much as 90%. And you can bet that there's a detail or two missing from that chapter of the history books. A lot of that population decline I mentioned gets blamed not on the colonizers themselves, but on the diseases that they carried, which led to major outbreaks. Historians sometimes call these outbreaks virgin soil epidemics because diseases like measles and smallox were new to Native American populations. So, their immune systems hadn't built up any resistance to them, which made the diseases incredibly deadly and widespread. And while it is true that epidemics killed many people, the whole truth isn't quite so straightforward. Research shows that it was disease in combination with all the other fallout from European colonization, including but not limited to war, enslavement, and starvation that made Native Americans especially vulnerable. And this nuance is important because if you focus primarily on disease, it obscures the truth that colonizers purposely killed millions of people and harmed many more. Now, just a warning. I'm about to get into an example of genocide. This is some heavy history, and it's important to take care. In 1848, the discovery of gold in California incited a rush of settlers who engaged in what was literally called Indian hunting. This practice was not only legal, but encouraged. In 1851, Governor Peter Bernett declared that a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct. State and federal governments spent nearly $2 million on what's referred to today as the California genocide. In all, the native population of California dropped from around $350,000 at first contact to about 18,000 by 1880. And that was very much intentional. This is hard history to tell just right because when we focus on all the horrible things that have happened to native peoples, it can create the impression that we were passive throughout it, that we were and are victims, when in reality, we're so much more than that. For starters, not all interactions between Native Americans and Europeans were the same. Cooperation and exchange did happen. And I'm not just talking about the Wampaog teaching the pilgrims how to grow corn. In many cases, Native American tribes dealt with Europeans using diplomacy or trade and created strategic alliances that gave them advantages over other native nations. For instance, tribes such as the Aangquins, the Inu, and the Windot allied with the French, and many traded furs for valuable European imports such as guns. But unlike French fur traders, British colonists were more likely to demand control over native people and their land, which led to some major conflicts. Sometimes tribes join forces to fight off an invasion, like in the case of Pontiac's rebellion, named for the Ottawa chief who coordinated a bunch of tribes across the Ohio River Valley and the Great Lakes region to try to oust the British. In response to the uprising, King George III signed a proclamation of 1763, drawing a boundary around indigenous lands that European settlers couldn't cross. And then you've got one of the most famous military victories for Native Americans, the Battle of the Little Bigghorn. In 1875, the US government was trying to force the Lakota Sue onto reservations, and they pushed even harder when gold was discovered in the South Dakota Black Hills, which are sacred to them. When the tribe refused to sell, the US tossed a former treaty to the wind and sent in last Kuster and his calvary, who were met with a prompt defeat. The story doesn't end there. The US retaliated by illegally seizing the Black Hills 2 years later, and now they look like this. But the story doesn't end there, either. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that the land had been wrongfully taken and awarded the Sue Nation $12 million as compensation. $12 million. Those were some fat stacks. But the Lakota Sue pulled a baller move when faced with that offer. They said, ""No, we are nothing without the Black Hills."" Chi chang historian Nick Estus said in a documentary on the subject. That's why the Black Hills are not for sale because we are not for sale. Mic drop. Native resistance continues today. And sometimes that looks like riding the historical record. Remember when I said that the Tyino population was devastated by Spanish colonization? They were labeled extinct soon after a 1565 census listed only 200 naves living on Hispanola. But that doesn't tell the whole story. In 1533, the Spanish had freed enslaved native people, but not enslaved Africans. So to keep their enslaved workers, many Spanish colonizers reclassified Tyenos as Africans. Nice loophole, guys. And in the early 1800s, the Spanish changed their census categories so that Puerto Ricans could identify themselves only as white or non-white. Tinyos themselves didn't disappear. Their label did. A label that was created by colonizers. [Music] Nevertheless, Tino culture persisted for centuries in passed down stories and traditions like baking cassav, a type of yuca bread. And after decades of research, a major shakeup happened in the early 2000s when a study out of the University of Puerto Rico revealed that 23 to 30% of Dominicans, 33% of Cubans, and 61% of Puerto Ricans had indigenous genes. The research confirmed what Tino people already knew, that they're still here, despite the efforts of what they call a paper genocide, meaning a sort of erasure from history through what might otherwise seem like boring old paperwork. Fortunately, by the 2010 census, Puerto Ricans could label themselves as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and awareness for Tino ancestry continues to grow. In 2016, a group of researchers from across Europe, the US, and Mexico was able to sequence and analyze ancient Tino DNA from a thousand-year-old tooth found on the island of Alra in the Bahamas. It showed even stronger evidence of a continued indigenous presence in the Caribbean, especially in Puerto Rico, which is so cool. It makes me think about how important the stories we tell are to understanding ourselves and our history. All this goes to show just how wrong the idea of a single first contact between Europeans and Native Americans really is. Instead, there were hundreds of contacts across hundreds of years that reshaped the land we now call the US and the people on it. But that reshaping isn't over. Next time we'll talk about treaties and how Native have been using them to get their land back. And I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-07-15,2025,656,10.933333333333334,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gmncfkeh7E,"On a dark winter night in 1945, a shout rang out on the banks of the Nusquali River. You're under arrest. Billy Frank Jr., just 14 at the time, called back, ""Leave me alone. I live here."" before being hauled off to a holding cell. He didn't know it then, but his arrest was one of the earliest battles in what would later be known as the Fish Wars. Hi, I'm Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] That night on the river, Frank Jr. was checking his fishing nets just like his ancestors had done for generations. He was a member of the Nusquali Nation, one of many in the Pacific Northwest that fished the rivers there for ages. It was his first time being arrested, but it wouldn't be the last. In the years to come, he'd be handcuffed at least 50 more times, threatened, and harassed too many times to count. and he'd inspired dozens of others to join him in his nonviolent resistance. See, for native people, the food you eat defines who you are and not in a health consscious you are what you eat kind of way. Frank Jr. and other members of the Nusquali had a strong connection to the fish they ate. For them, salmon were gifts from the creator to be honored and protected, even if that meant facing jail time. [Music] But to understand how it ever came to that, let's take a step back. In episode two, we talked about sovereignty, the right of native nations to govern themselves. Today, we're going to talk about a different kind of self-governance, food sovereignty. The right of native nations to use the foods that have sustained their communities since time in memorial. Before Europeans arrived, natives from coast to coast had their own distinct culturally defined behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes surrounding their traditional foods. Their menus were local and seasonal, rotating among hundreds of different kinds of plants and animals. Like the Elgangquin tribes knew June as the strawberry moon, the month that marks the beginning of berry season. And the Shauni knew September as the paw pa moon, the month when you can enjoy an enormous custody fruit that's like the mango of the Midwest. Native peoples also stockpiled certain foods to enjoy year round. like many in what's now California created a flower out of raw acorns by drying, shelling, smashing, and flushing out their bitterness. Then they' use it to whip up a batch of soup, bread, or mush. Other native nations like the whole Neoni and Cherokee depended on corn grown either on its own or closely planted with beans and squash. They knew these crops as the three sisters because like family, they protected each other and grew better together. Unlike the two brothers, orange juice and toothpaste, which are sworn enemies. But all that changed when Europeans began colonizing the land we now call the United States. In just over 300 years, native nations across the country lost 99% of the lands where they hunted, fish, gathered, and grown food for longer than anyone can remember. And between the 19th and 20th centuries, as the US government forced native people off their lands, they used federal boarding schools to eradicate their cultures altogether. Native children were separated from their families, their languages, their traditions, and their foods. Students in boarding schools were often fed lowquality rations and punished if they ate anything they' personally grown while laboring on the school farms. At the same time that native people were being separated from their traditional foods, settlers were exploiting those food sources in unsustainable ways. Like traditionally the great Sue called themselves Payo Yate or Buffalo Nation, viewing buffalo as a source of everything they needed to survive. What they ate, what they wore, how they sheltered themselves. They even played an important role in their creation story. In the early 19th century, at least 30 million buffalo roamed the plains. But as railroads expanded west, hunters on those trains killed the herds in mass. The numbers vary, but by 1887, it's likely that fewer than 100 individual buffalo remained in the wild. Not only did this eliminate a traditional food source for many, but for groups like the Great Sue, it destroyed their way of life, too. And that destruction was often the point. American soldiers were ordered to kill every buffalo on site because, quote, ""Every buffalo dead was an Indian gone."" The US government knew that without the buffalo, Native Americans would starve, which meant that they would be more willing to sign treaties and hand over land to them. Which brings us back to Billy Frank Jr. and the fish wars. In the mid- 19th century, the Nusquali and other native nations who had defined themselves as salmon people, signed treaties with the US government, seeding millions of acres of land in what's now Washington state. But they signed under a few big conditions, including that they'd keep the right to fish there, just as they always had. But thanks to decades of logging, mining, commercial fishing, and other man-made activities, by the mid 20th century, the salmon population was collapsing, just as the buffalo had done before them. And under state laws passed to protect the fish, law enforcement started cracking down on fishing, but not in the offshore spots where bougie fishing boats were catching most of the salmon. They disproportionately monitored the riverbanks, where native people and their nets took in less than 5% of the annual catch. cuz that's fair. And that's how Frank Jr. first got arrested for fishing, which at the time he didn't consider to be a political act. It was more about having something to eat. But the arrest didn't stop. Frank Jr. and the other native fishers knew the history of their treaty rights. They knew exercising those rights was legal according to the US government, but illegal according to state law. And they knew that having access to fish supported their health, their cultural identity, and their survival. And well, that's all pretty political. So, the fish wars began. By the 1960s, Frank Jr. and other native activists were taking part in nonviolent acts of civil disobedience, which is when people intentionally break laws as a form of protest. They staged demonstrations, including fish, where they asserted their treaty rights. They face sabotage and violence from non-native fishermen and clashes with state police. But they also attracted nationwide attention, drawing support from celebrities like Marlon Brando. And Frank Jr. got arrested a lot. He was good at it. I was not a policy guy, he once said. I was a getting arrested guy. Then in 1974, he and other native activists finally got their day in court. In a landmark decision called the Bolt decision, the judge upheld the treaty rights and ruled that native nations in Washington were entitled to half of the harvestable catch. Can you make some noise for this huge win? And that brings me to an important point. Food sovereignty really can't be separated from regular sovereignty. When communities can't practice their traditional food ways or access highquality foods, like we saw with the Great Sue and the Nquali, the health and well-being of those communities suffers. While it doesn't always lead to civil disobedience like in the fish wars, every native nation in the US has experienced some type of disruption to the traditional food systems. And often those distinct experiences bleed together into a common story, one about separation and resilience. Take fried bread for example, a dectable deep fried disc of flour, salt, water, and baking powder that's a staple at Powows. But the dish itself has a complicated past. Frib's origins likely traced back to the 1860s when the US government forced thousands of members of the Navajo nation to leave their homelands. Hundreds died on that nearly 500 km journey to a reservation in what's now New Mexico. And the survivors found the land wasn't good for growing their traditional staples of corn, beans, and squash. So the government rations of white flour, sugar, and lard helped them make the dough for fry bread. Other native nations who were given similar rations started leaning on fried bread, too. Some native people today see fry bread as a reminder of how traditional food systems have been torn apart, contributing to high rates of diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses. But to others, fried bread represents comfort and resilience wrapped up in one, making something out of nothing and stretching it far enough to feed everybody. We can find that same resilience that ignited the fish wars and brought us fried bread in the many native food initiatives happening across the United States today. The Mongol Food Sovereignty Project, for example, hosts harvest festivals, maintains a community garden, and teaches tribal members how to prepare salmon and elk. The Cherokee Nation shares free heirloom seed packets with their members, encouraging them to grow and eat the same crops as their ancestors. And the three sisters project at Iowa State University partners with native gardeners to study how growing corn, beans, and squash together nourishes people, plants, and the soil. Plus, native chefs have been making their mark in the culinary world, opening restaurants, publishing cookbooks, and working to bring traditional foods into the limelight. Like Mariah Gladstone, a member of the Black Feet and Cherokee Nations, and the host of Indiga Kitchen, an online cooking show. She shares traditional food knowledge, teaching viewers how to make penican and basamic menomomen with dandelion greens. For thousands of years, native nations hunted, fished, grew, and gathered food that sustained their communities and the places where they lived. Under colonization, they face violent disconnection from those food systems and witness many of their food sources disappear. But native people also recognize that when you nourish a community, you support its ability to exist. now and in the future. And that's why many native nations have fought to keep traditional foods in their communities or are working to put them back. Today, the salmon in the Nquali River still face threats from dams, habitat destruction, and overh harvesting, but the state of Washington now co-manages the river and the fish alongside the Nwali and other native nations. And as for Billy Frank Jr., He remained active in protecting the trib's treaty rights until his death in 2014. A year after his death, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a National Wildlife Refuge was named in his honor. In our next episode, we'll go back in time to Native Americans first contact with Europeans. I will see you then.

[Music]",what are the fish wars and why do they matter?  ep 9 of crash course native american history,"on a dark winter night in 1945, a shout rang out on the banks of the nusquali river. you're under arrest. billy frank jr., just 14 at the time, called back, ""leave me alone. i live here."" before being hauled off to a holding cell. he didn't know it then, but his arrest was one of the earliest battles in what would later be known as the fish wars. hi, i'm jim and welcome to crash course native american history.  music  that night on the river, frank jr. was checking his fishing nets just like his ancestors had done for generations. he was a member of the nusquali nation, one of many in the pacific northwest that fished the rivers there for ages. it was his first time being arrested, but it wouldn't be the last. in the years to come, he'd be handcuffed at least 50 more times, threatened, and harassed too many times to count. and he'd inspired dozens of others to join him in his nonviolent resistance. see, for native people, the food you eat defines who you are and not in a health consscious you are what you eat kind of way. frank jr. and other members of the nusquali had a strong connection to the fish they ate. for them, salmon were gifts from the creator to be honored and protected, even if that meant facing jail time.  music  but to understand how it ever came to that, let's take a step back. in episode two, we talked about sovereignty, the right of native nations to govern themselves. today, we're going to talk about a different kind of self-governance, food sovereignty. the right of native nations to use the foods that have sustained their communities since time in memorial. before europeans arrived, natives from coast to coast had their own distinct culturally defined behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes surrounding their traditional foods. their menus were local and seasonal, rotating among hundreds of different kinds of plants and animals. like the elgangquin tribes knew june as the strawberry moon, the month that marks the beginning of berry season. and the shauni knew september as the paw pa moon, the month when you can enjoy an enormous custody fruit that's like the mango of the midwest. native peoples also stockpiled certain foods to enjoy year round. like many in what's now california created a flower out of raw acorns by drying, shelling, smashing, and flushing out their bitterness. then they' use it to whip up a batch of soup, bread, or mush. other native nations like the whole neoni and cherokee depended on corn grown either on its own or closely planted with beans and squash. they knew these crops as the three sisters because like family, they protected each other and grew better together. unlike the two brothers, orange juice and toothpaste, which are sworn enemies. but all that changed when europeans began colonizing the land we now call the united states. in just over 300 years, native nations across the country lost 99  of the lands where they hunted, fish, gathered, and grown food for longer than anyone can remember. and between the 19th and 20th centuries, as the us government forced native people off their lands, they used federal boarding schools to eradicate their cultures altogether. native children were separated from their families, their languages, their traditions, and their foods. students in boarding schools were often fed lowquality rations and punished if they ate anything they' personally grown while laboring on the school farms. at the same time that native people were being separated from their traditional foods, settlers were exploiting those food sources in unsustainable ways. like traditionally the great sue called themselves payo yate or buffalo nation, viewing buffalo as a source of everything they needed to survive. what they ate, what they wore, how they sheltered themselves. they even played an important role in their creation story. in the early 19th century, at least 30 million buffalo roamed the plains. but as railroads expanded west, hunters on those trains killed the herds in mass. the numbers vary, but by 1887, it's likely that fewer than 100 individual buffalo remained in the wild. not only did this eliminate a traditional food source for many, but for groups like the great sue, it destroyed their way of life, too. and that destruction was often the point. american soldiers were ordered to kill every buffalo on site because, quote, ""every buffalo dead was an indian gone."" the us government knew that without the buffalo, native americans would starve, which meant that they would be more willing to sign treaties and hand over land to them. which brings us back to billy frank jr. and the fish wars. in the mid- 19th century, the nusquali and other native nations who had defined themselves as salmon people, signed treaties with the us government, seeding millions of acres of land in what's now washington state. but they signed under a few big conditions, including that they'd keep the right to fish there, just as they always had. but thanks to decades of logging, mining, commercial fishing, and other man-made activities, by the mid 20th century, the salmon population was collapsing, just as the buffalo had done before them. and under state laws passed to protect the fish, law enforcement started cracking down on fishing, but not in the offshore spots where bougie fishing boats were catching most of the salmon. they disproportionately monitored the riverbanks, where native people and their nets took in less than 5  of the annual catch. cuz that's fair. and that's how frank jr. first got arrested for fishing, which at the time he didn't consider to be a political act. it was more about having something to eat. but the arrest didn't stop. frank jr. and the other native fishers knew the history of their treaty rights. they knew exercising those rights was legal according to the us

The Podawatami tells stories about this with trees gathering together, making plans. Stories where the trees decide how to grow, how many seeds to produce, how to survive. And in recent years, non-native botnists have picked up on the same thing. Trees really are communicating. They share resources and information through chemicals in the air and networks underground. So, how did native peoples thousands of years ago figure out something that western scientists are only just discovering? Hi, I'm Jim and this is Crash Course Native American History. [Music] Science is a useful tool for understanding the world. It's helped us figure out really complex ideas like particle physics and evolution and microwave popcorn. And native people have made plenty of scientific discoveries, yet we're often perceived as anti-science. So, what gives? Turns out what we typically consider science today isn't the only way to arrive at accurate information. There are a variety of ways of knowing or means through which people discover knowledge. And many Native American ways of knowing are rooted in observing the earth and living in close relationship to it since time immemorial. To paraphrase Pawatami writer and botnist Dr. Robin Wall Kimmeer. We tend to think of science as being neutral and objective where the conclusions drawn are influenced by the people doing the concluding. But years ago, Western scientists assumed plants didn't communicate because they don't do so in the ways that look like animal communication. And later, when scientists revisited that question with the understanding that communication could look really different from what they'd expect, bingo, they started to find compelling evidence, which just goes to show that all knowledge is influenced by the perspectives we humans bring to it. And Native American cultures, even with all of our diversity, tend to have some commonalities in our ways of knowing and viewing the world, like how we tend to ground relationships and respect and reciprocity. There's much more about indigenous world views, by the way, in episode 6. Indigenous ways of knowing often begin, much like the scientific method, with observation. But in Native American cultures, this observation can go beyond the five senses and involve things like storytelling and oral history. Take these rare boulder structures built by native people in the plains region of the US and Canada, known today as medicine wheels. Most follow similar structural patterns like a series of concentric circles or spokes radiating from a mound of stones in the center. Many date back centuries or even millennia, but there's little archaeological evidence as to the purpose of medicine wheels. Were they built to use as astronomical tools, locations for rituals? For those answers, many western practices of archaeology have proven insufficient. We need indigenous knowledge. So archaeologists in Alberta, Canada worked with elders of the Blackfoot Confederacy to learn more about these formations. John Wolfchild of the Kai Nation offered stories about his late great uncle, the warrior and tribal chief McCoy Puck, who was honored with a medicine wheel memorial. Wolfchug could paint a picture of McCoy Puck, including his famous top knot decorated with feathers from his travels. He sounds like a baller. Sadly, the McCoy Puck medicine wheel itself has been lost to cultivation with only a ravine and depressions in the ground to show where it once was. But Wolfchild's stories can inform how we interpret other medicine wheels, which adds an important context to our understanding of human history. Now, Native Americans did and continue to do a lot more with their ways of knowing than observe and remember. They also invent and create. In fact, Native Americans spearheaded a bunch of technological innovations millennia ago that are still used today. Like the first kayaks were invented by the Inuit, built from seal skin around 4,000 years ago. Lacrosse was invented by the Honosi before European settlers arrived. And the Chumash people ventured out to sea far before the ancient cultures of Egypt, Asia, or Europe did. I'm talking 11,000 years ago. The Chumash sailed back and forth from the Channel Islands to the mainland of what's now Southern California, fishing with complex hooks and nets, as well as hunting for seals and waterfell. Over time, they used their knowledge of the ocean and the Pacific coastline to build some of the most technologically advanced ships in North America, like the Tommo. These canoes could be up to 30 feet long and consisted of planks tied together. They were made watertight with pine tar, which was boiled and hardened. The preferred material was redwoods that had drifted down the coast from the north because the Chumash knew, you know, they had their ways of knowing that this wood rotted much more slowly than the other types. All of this reflects how native ways of knowing have been making things happen for thousands and thousands of years. And in many cases, these innovations are still a part of both native and non-native life today. Like the Chumar people still build tombl that could be seen gliding along the ocean near the channel islands. While western scientists have long misunderstood and at times downright disregarded native ways of knowing, that's slowly starting to change. Today, there's a new movement aimed at braiding the two world views together. The Migma people have a word for this braiding edu. It means two-eyed scene, a concept developed by Migmog Elder Albert Marshall. The idea is that one eye should look through the lens of native knowledge, the other through the lens of western science, but both should work together to form the full picture. For example, in 2023, Nicole man embodied Iduptuk when she made history as the first indigenous woman in space. She's a NASA astronaut and a member of the Waki of the Round Valley Indian tribes and she spent 157 days in a floating laboratory on the International Space Station. While she was on board, man performed spacew walks, spoke to students back on Earth, and studied plant growth. She later told reporters that there's a psychological aspect to growing plants in space that helps you feel connected to your home planet, one that could benefit humans on long space voyages in the future and a sentiment that reflects the deep connection to place found in native ways of knowing. While in orbit, she also had the opportunity to speak to students at the Flathead Indian Reservation, something she saw as a really important responsibility. Her hope was that it might inspire native children to pursue their own careers in science. The next end of native space explorers is going to be epic. Back on Earth, two-eyed seeing is being used to tackle some of the world's most pressing issues. Like today, around 2 million of Earth's species face extinction thanks to human activity. But this decline is happening at a significantly slower rate on indigenous lands where globally there's less deforestation and lower pollution levels. Yeah, we're cool like that. Thanks to their deeply rooted connection to their lands, native people have developed some of the most effective means of environmental care. In fact, today many conservationists see indigenous land management as one of the best ways to protect against biodiversity loss. For example, in what's now Montana, the Confederated Salish and Coupney tribes or the CSKT have long practice controlled burns to encourage new plant growth and reduce the risk of forest fires. Today, they manage over 400,000 acres of conservation land, including the CSKT Bison Range, a former national wildlife refuge established on the land originally taken from the tribes in the early 20th century. After negotiating for many years to have the land returned to the tribes, it was successfully restored to their care in 2020. Now under the management of the CSKT Natural Resource Department, tribal biologists use controlled burns to remove fire hazards, protect native plants, and open up more grazing for the bison who live on the range. In addition, the Bison Range Museum is now used to educate visitors about the trib's history and their traditional practices. Initiatives like this have been so successful that simply giving more land back to native peoples have been suggested as a major strategy for combating climate change. We'll talk much more about native ecology in a future episode. Indigenous people have been learning about and connecting to the world since longer than anyone can remember. Listening to the trees, protecting buffalo herds, and much more. And way before scientists was even a word, native folks weren't just learning, but they were actively inventing and still are. But they're also finding ways to bring Western science into the fold, too. And in the spirit of two-eyed scene, native scientists like Nicole Man are passing on both to future generations. As we say here at Crash Course, knowledge weighs nothing. Carry all that you can. In our next episode, we're going to talk about traditional Native Foods. I'll see you then.

floating laboratory on the international space station. while she was on board, man performed spacew walks, spoke to students back on earth, and studied plant growth. she later told reporters that there's a psychological aspect to growing plants in space that helps you feel connected to your home planet, one that could benefit humans on long space voyages in the future and a sentiment that reflects the deep connection to place found in native ways of knowing. while in orbit, she also had the opportunity to speak to students at the flathead indian reservation, something she saw as a really important responsibility. her hope was that it might inspire native children to pursue their own careers in science. the next end of native space explorers is going to be epic. back on earth, two-eyed seeing is being used to tackle some of the world's most pressing issues. like today, around 2 million of earth's species face extinction thanks to human activity. but this decline is happening at a significantly slower rate on indigenous lands where globally there's less deforestation and lower pollution levels. yeah, we're cool like that. thanks to their deeply rooted connection to their lands, native people have developed some of the most effective means of environmental care. in fact, today many conservationists see indigenous land management as one of the best ways to protect against biodiversity loss. for example, in what's now montana, the confederated salish and coupney tribes or the cskt have long practice controlled burns to encourage new plant growth and reduce the risk of forest fires. today, they manage over 400,000 acres of conservation land, including the cskt bison range, a former national wildlife refuge established on the land originally taken from the tribes in the early 20th century. after negotiating for many years to have the land returned to the tribes, it was successfully restored to their care in 2020. now under the management of the cskt natural resource department, tribal biologists use controlled burns to remove fire hazards, protect native plants, and open up more grazing for the bison who live on the range. in addition, the bison range museum is now used to educate visitors about the trib's history and their traditional practices. initiatives like this have been so successful that simply giving more land back to native peoples have been suggested as a major strategy for combating climate change. we'll talk much more about native ecology in a future episode. indigenous people have been learning about and connecting to the world since longer than anyone can remember. listening to the trees, protecting buffalo herds, and much more. and way before scientists was even a word, native folks weren't just learning, but they were actively inventing and still are. but they're also finding ways to bring western science into the fold, too. and in the spirit of two-eyed scene, native scientists like nicole man are passing on both to future generations. as we say here at crash course, knowledge weighs nothing. carry all that you can. in our next episode, we're going to talk about traditional native foods. i'll see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course  native american history, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis, indiana, and was made with the help of all these nice people.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-07-01,2025,697,11.616666666666667,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_MjSrQk1VU,"In 1897, some 20,000 people paid a quarter each to gawk at six living, breathing Inuit who had just arrived in New York Harbor. They had been brought from Greenland by explorer Robert E. Perry. Anthropologist France Boaz had suggested inviting a single Enoch back to New York for the winter to collect information of the greatest scientific importance. For reasons known only to Perry, he brought back six, plus barrels full of bones stolen from Inuit graves. Among the living was a young boy named Mick whose life along with others highlights the fraught relationship between native peoples and western anthropologist. Hi, I'm Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. Anthropology is the study of what it means to be human, which involves a lot. Everything from how people use language to what they eat to their genetics. Archaeology, a sub field of anthropology, has to do with understanding past humans by studying what they left behind. Old buildings, tools, even human remains. Those are pretty impressive goals. Understand humanity past and present. But anthropology and archaeology grew from twisted colonial roots. At first, from Europeans trying to understand the indigenous peoples in the places they taken over, often positioning themselves as objective observers. and the native folks as inhuman specimens. And often taking native land went handinhand with taking native bodies. And I want to let you know now, we're about to talk about some dark and heavy history. It's difficult to note the exact numbers, but between the 1780s and the 1970s, it's estimated that people in the US dug up anywhere from 600,000 to over 1 million native graves. Even some of America's founding fathers got in on it. Sometime around 1780, Thomas Jefferson unearthed a native burial mound near his home in Virginia. He was curious about who built it, but not curious enough to ask the native folks he'd seen paying respects. Jefferson estimated there might have been a thousand skeletons buried there. That's great, Tom. By the 19th century, soothing out native graves in the name of science was big business. The going rate for a skull was estimated to be $3 to5 or about $99 to $165 in today's money. American museums were vindictions of bones and their reputations as serious places of science. Many generally believe that by taking artifacts, including human remains, from native communities, they were helping preserve the history of the people who'd soon be gone forever. Early museums had even set up displays of native bodies alongside dinosaur fossils and those of other extinct species. Hello, not extinct, still here. Often digging up native graves wasn't even about research or furthering the study of humanity. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Americans of all ages were into collecting native artifacts and remains for fun. Country doctors, philanthropic society ladies, and wealthy collectors. Even the Boy Scouts joined in. I didn't know that there was a merit badge for grave robbing. Some early anthropologists and other scientists wanted to get their hands on native remains to measure skulls looking to prove bogus claims of white superiority. Insecure much? Czech anthropologist Elish herd Lichka was among them. He dug up and stole the remains of 800 CIO people among others. By the time he died in 1943, he had almost 20,000 skulls in his possession. And William McGee, the first president of the American Anthropological Association, wrote in 1901 that Native Americans were quote strikingly close to subhuman species in every aspect. He also dropped out of school at 14. So let that be a lesson. Stay in school, kids. Even anthropologist France Boaz, who argued that no culture or group of people is better than another, felt digging up native remains was necessary to uncover what humans had in common. In 1888, he wrote in his diary, ""It is the most unpleasant work to steal bones from a grave, but someone has to do it."" I'd argue, in fact, someone does not have to do it. Fron, which brings us back to Manik, because all these biases about Native Americans didn't just affect how anthropologists treated Native ancestors, it also affected how they treated living people. Manik and the other Inuit were brought to live in the basement of New York's Museum of Natural History, where they were studied and ooled by curious crowds. But four of them soon contracted tuberculosis and passed away, including Manik's father, Kisuk. The last remaining adult was returned to the Arctic, leaving only Manik in New York. A funeral for Kisuk was held in the museum's garden, but the body on display was a fake. In reality, all the bodies had been dissected and kept at the museum where Herd Lichka, the terrifying one from earlier, studied and wrote articles about them. Minik spent the rest of his life petitioning the museum to return the remains of his father and the other Inuit whose bones had been secretly stolen. He even sought the help of President Theodore Roosevelt. But it didn't work. The museum denied him again and again. And when Manik died during the 1918 flu pandemic, his father's remains were still in the museum's collection. And what's especially haunting is that Minik's story wasn't an anomaly. The Smithsonian alone still holds 18,500 ancestral remains, many of them collected by her lichka. So for almost 190 years, native people were treated as objects to be displayed and studied. Many early anthropologists felt they needed to salvage knowledge of native cultures before colonization destroyed them altogether. And for those of you who don't speak colonizer, salvage roughly means to steal. [Music] Great piece for the museum. Oh, look at this. Oh, how exotic. Yes. Not today, Carl. [Music] Museum. Grave robbing. What a legacy. But native communities were already keepers of their own cultures. And even when anthropologists were collecting stories, not bones, they didn't always treat this as a partnership with native people. Vernon Finley, director of the Coupney Culture Committee, recalls his grandfather describing how anthropologists rarely interpreted elders stories correctly or let elders know what they do with those stories. Back then, anthropologists love to work on a just trust us basis that they maybe hadn't earned. And of course, there were all those thousands of ancestors remains. But that started to change in the late 1960s with the arrival of groups like the American Indian Movement or AIM, a nativeled civil rights coalition which expressed widespread feelings of anger at the exploitation of native people. Members of AIM staged protests at excavation sites and roadside attractions where ancestral remains were still on display. And believe me, back then those were everywhere. This country is so haunted. Thanks in part to pressure from indigenous activists like these, the law slowly began to change, starting with the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 and the Archaeological Resources and Protection Act in 1979. Both laws helped establish more protections for native archaeological sites and begin to shift the control of those sites back to native peoples. Then in 1990 came a super significant piece of legislation, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act or NAGPRA. NAGPRA Nagra Nagpra aimed to help the return of both artifacts and ancestral remains to the rightful tribe upon request. The museums that held those materials had to consult with tribes about them, and the law created a process for how federal agencies should handle any remains or materials found in the future. Finally, no more rogue scientists on the loose. But more than 30 years since NAGPRO was passed, between 300,000 and 600,000 remains are still held in museums across the country. And in part, that's because this system is far from perfect. For one, it only applies to institutions that have accepted federal funding. Also, sometimes it's hard to determine exactly which tribe human remains or artifacts came from, which can and has been used as an excuse for holding on to these objects. But when it comes to more just, respectful anthropology, NACRA isn't the end of the line. In the 1970s, a collaboration between archaeologists and the Macau tribe in the Pacific Northwest proved that respectful excavations could be successful. After a storm exposed an ancient whailing village, the Macau brought in archaeologists who worked for 11 years to excavate thousands of wooden artifacts, baskets, animal bones, and longouses. By combining the trib's oral histories of a great mudslide with the scientists' findings that the artifacts were about 500 years old, they were able to create a more complete picture of the area's history. The McCall retained all 55,000 unearthed artifacts as a condition of the dig, which the tribe now curates at the mall cultural and research center, which completely unrelated, is super close to where the Twilight movie takes place. #team Jacob. We names got to stick together. And today more and more indigenous people are changing how research gets done through decolonized archaeology and anthropology which are described as with, for, and by indigenous people. This research values native sovereignty, knowledge, and perspectives and involves collaborating using tribal members own interpretations. And above all, it keeps native peoples in charge of managing their own heritage. And if all this sounds like the opposite of early archaeology and anthropology, that's because it is. In fact, when indigenous archaeology first began in the 1990s, some Native Americans saw it as an oxymoron. How could an indigenous person participate in a field that has caused so much harm to their people. But some saw it as a way to truly control our cultural resources and make it much more difficult for prejudiced ideas about Native Americans to spread. Linda Tuhiwise Smith, author of a book on how to decolonize research, explained it like this. When indigenous peoples become the researchers and not merely the research, the activity of research is transformed. I'll leave you with this. In 2021, the American Anthropological Association issued an apology for all the harm that it's done historically. And though it didn't happen in Manik's lifetime, thanks to the tireless work of others like him, his father's body was eventually returned to his ancestral homelands in 1993. Archaeology and anthropology started as fields that both accidentally and purposefully harmed indigenous peoples even after they were dead. And while strides have been made in recent years, largely as a result of dedicated indigenous activists, there's still a long way to go. But indigenous anthropologists are working to make the field more just, not only for the people of the past, but for the future as well. In our next episode, we'll continue our discussion about indigenous science when we talk about ways of knowing the world. And I will see you then.

Sometimes these desires live in the realm of fantasy where just a mental image turns a person on and they don't actually act on it. Other times those desires are an active part of someone's sex life. As a culture, we often think of kinks as the Diablo level in the Taco Bell hot sauce taxonomy. Mild is for the masses, but only some go for the really hot spicy stuff. Except apparently a lot of people go for the spicy hot stuff. And kinks, they're more common than you might think. As we learned way back in our first episode, our ideas about which sexual expressions are normal are shaped by the time and place we live in. In reality, when it comes to sexuality and sexual behavior, variety is the norm. Just check out these three studies from Canada, Italy, and the US. Over half of surveyed Canadians said they'd fantasize about having sex in public or being dominated. 68% of Italians said they'd had a kinky fantasy at least once in their lives. The most common being voyerism or getting aroused by watching someone else get undressed, be naked, or engage in sexual activity. And more than 90% of surveyed Americans said they'd fantasized about being dominated or dominating their partner. No, the survey was not conducted in a movie theater showing 50 Shades of Gray. But why, Shan? I hear you asking. Why do some people like pain or tentacle stuff or wearing diapers? Wherefore out thou kinky? Well, compared to other sex related topics, there hasn't been a ton of research about kinks. But from what studies have been done so far, the answer may be a lot of reasons. One hypothesis is that kinks are learned. Kind of like how Pavlov's dog started drooling when they heard a bell because they associated the sound with dinnertime. Sometimes if an early experience of pleasure co-stars a not obviously sexy object, sexy feelings can become linked to it and voila, a kink is born. Certain kinks may also correlate with personality traits like if someone is introverted or extroverted and those traits can be influenced by genetics. But the data on this is especially limited. It's just not something many researchers have asked people about. You also might have heard these kinds of sexual interests described as fetishes, but a fetish isn't the same thing as a kink. A kink broadly describes taboo sexual behaviors, even if they're not actually that unusual. But a fetish is a particular type of kink where somebody's aroused by a specific object like leather or underwear or a non-genital body part like hair or feet. In any case, one 2017 study found that if somebody had a fetish, that's not the only way they wanted to have sex. They just extra enjoyed it that way. Here's the thing, though. When Diablo sauce or mango habanero or debomb isn't something you're personally into, it's easy to get caught up in your own ick and judge people who do like it. That's part of why some people with fetishes may hesitate to tell their partners about them. But as long as everybody involved consents, kinks and fetishes can be a fun and fulfilling part of sex. Like to give one big example, a kink that often gets misunderstood is BDSM. The definition has changed over time, but today it's generally understood to cover bondage, discipline, and submission and sadism and masochism. Sex acts that often play with power dynamics or giving and receiving pain. Which might sound surprising. How does translate into ooh? Well, there's some evidence that the processing of pleasure and pain are closely linked in the brain since they both are tangled up in the opioid and dopamine systems. But playing with pain requires caution. Research has shown that injuries from BDSM activities do happen both intentionally and unintentionally, but the BDSM community puts a strong emphasis on consent and safety. In good BDSM practices, it's crucial to talk about what's on the table and what's off limits before getting started, to use a safe word that puts a stop to the action at any time, and to move back into a place of care and gentleness as things taper off. And for many, it's the meaning given to the pain that makes it pleasurable. Some people who enjoy BDSM say the contrast of pain makes the feeling of pleasure stronger. Kind of like adding salt to chocolate chip cookies to bring out the sweetness. And sometimes BDSM isn't all about having sex. For a lot of people, the appeal is giving up power or taking power in ways they don't always get to do in their everyday lives, what's called power exchange. The same could be said for furries. People who roleplay as human-like animals through art, writing, or dressing up in costumes known as fursuits as a part of their persona. For some furries, that's partially a sex thing, but not always. The appeal can also be imagination, play, and the freedom of shedding their regular selves for a while. Whether sex is part of the picture or not, no matter the reason, humans do be kinky. But is there a point where kinky behaviors go from fun spicy taco topping to why would anyone make a sauce that hot? In other words, is there a point where kinks become a problem? Well, it depends. Any good thing can become a problem if taken to extremes. But where exactly that line falls can be complicated. So-called abnormal sexual interests aren't inherently bad. The DSM5, the American Psychiatric Association's guide for classifying and diagnosing mental illnesses, uses the term paraphilia. Parah meaning going beyond and filia meaning attachment to describe an intense and persistent sexual interest between consenting adult partners. By itself, this isn't necessarily a problem. But if someone's paraphilia becomes distressing or harmful to themselves or others, the DSM5 classifies it as a paraphilic disorder. In this case, someone might be referred to a counselor or prescribed a medication. Some experts warn that classifying certain behaviors as disorders is problematic because what's considered normal often depends on cultural and sociopolitical factors. So, there are calls for more research around paraphilic disorders to clarify the DSM's classifications. Kinks aren't for everybody. If they were, they wouldn't be kinks. But a lot of the ones that many people think of as unusual aren't as uncommon as they're made out to be. What we do, think, and feel when it comes to sex can be an expression of who we are, but it's also shaped by the time and place we live in. In the end, sexuality is deliciously diverse. That's a theme we've kept coming back to throughout this entire series. What's one person's yes, please might be another person's no thanks. And you know what? That's thrilling. There's room for everyone to have an amazing time with a partner who feels the same way. There's space to keep trying new things or return to tried and true favorites. No matter the recipe, good sex comes down to the same ingredients. It's consensual and it's safe. And there's trust, fun, and delight for everybody involved. And with that, Crash Course Sex Ed is a wrap. How you feeling, Teen Shan? You've definitely cleared a lot of things up. Thanks, old Shan. Girl, what are you calling old? Whoops. One more condom balloon for the road. This episode of Crash Course Sex Ed was produced in partnership with the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.

I'm gonna go ahead and just say it. Masturbation. It's something that many people do throughout their lives. And humans are far from the only animals who like a little me time. But sometimes masturbation is coupled with shame. So, let's do what we do and talk about it. Hi, I'm Shamboo and this is Crash Course Sexed. Masturbation is stimulating your own genitals for sexual pleasure, which is a really clinical way to describe something humans have been enjoying for a long time. According to evolutionary biologists in some saucy prehistoric rock paintings, humans have been masturbating for probably as long as we've been around. And if it's not your thing, no sweat. But if it is, you're not alone. Even if no one's talking about it. Surveys show that most people masturbate regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, age, or relationship status. Yeah. So, it's not just dudes and single people. Masturbation is a totally normal part of human sexuality, and everyone has their own relationship to it, including how they do it. For instance, archaeologists have discovered objects that were used as sex toys going as far back as the Han Dynasty in ancient China. And today, sexual aids are making it possible for more people of all abilities to enjoy sex. Teensh, let him know. In the 1960s, there was a lot of free love, baby. But not everyone was included in this so-called sexual revolution, especially disabled people. They wanted to have sex and did, but a lot of non-disabled folks saw them as devoid of sexuality. That's where GZnell Duncan came in. In 1965, an accident left him paralyzed from the waist down, which caused him to not be able to get an erection. As he got involved in the disability rights movement, he learned he wasn't the only one thinking about the intersection of disability and sexuality. Part of the problem at the time, sex toys were not great. Most were made of harsh smelling rubber that couldn't be washed and that melted in heat. So Duncan worked with a chemist to create the world's first silicone dildo. Washable, sharable, and easily used with low hand mobility. And even though he made it for disabled folks, silicone became the thing in sex toys, which makes for a nicer, more hygienic time for people of all abilities. The world of sex toys has come a long way since those rubber dildos from the 60s. Today, there are tons of different kinds for all sorts of interests, sexualities, and abilities. A few words to the wise when it comes to sex toys. Use condoms for shared toys. Only use objects that are specifically made for sexy time. And the golden rule, nothing goes up the butt if it doesn't have a flared base. Otherwise, it could get sucked up there. Emergency rooms have truly seen it all, y'all. So, masturbation is natural and normal and has been around forever. But is paddling the pink canoe or polishing the banister good for you? Short answer, it can be. Beyond just feeling good, many people have reported that masturbation can help them relax, relieve anxiety and pain, and fall asleep. Scientists still have a lot to learn about why that is, but one reason could be the increase of the hormones dopamine and oxytocin during orgasm, which can counteract cortisol, aka the stress hormone. Masturbation also stimulates the release of neurotransmitters called endockinabonoids which regulate things like sleep, pain, and immune responses. And there might be some long-term medical benefits, too. Some research has even found that for people with vulvas, the increased blood flow from masturbating regularly can help keep genital tissue healthy. And other studies have found that for folks with penises, more frequent ejaculation has some relationship with lowering the risk of developing prostate cancer later on in life. Although it's not clear why yet, sex educators have also observed that masturbation can help people get to know their body and themselves as a sexual being. It can help them figure out what they like, what they don't like, and build a foundation they can explore with others if they choose to. With women in particular, studies have found that single women who masturbated reported being more sexually satisfied when they had partnered sex. And overall, women who masturbate are more sexually confident and have a more positive self-image. And masturbation provides all these benefits with no risk of STI or pregnancy. Now, that's what I call an MVP. Of course, there can be such a thing as masturbating too much. If it gets in the way of someone's responsibilities or social life, it's a good idea to talk to a doctor or a counselor. But in general, many studies have found evidence that the five finger shuffle can have upsides. So why do many cultures give it a bad rep? It turns out people haven't always been cy about masturbation. Back in the timeline, people openly acknowledged it more, including in creation stories. Like the ancient Sumerians believe one of their gods created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers by ejaculating. And the ancient Egyptians believe that one of their gods created the entire universe by masturbating. Now, that's some BDE. The ancient Greeks saw masturbation as a normal bodily function, but for them, it did have a judgy edge to it. It was seen as something for lowerass citizens, and they weren't the last to give masturbation some side eye. Many religions take a negative view of self-pleasure for different reasons. Some see masturbation as an expression of lust, while others teach that sex is something a person should only do with their spouse. But some of the shade has also come from historical doctors and scientists whose inaccurate ideas have bled over into the 21st century. For instance, in the 1700s, a famous Swiss doctor named Samuel Ugus Tiso popularized the idea that semen was quote a vital fluid that shouldn't be wasted on anything but procreation. In what turned into a global campaign, he and other doctors spread the belief that masturbation made you weak and infertile. And because back then people thought semen originated in the brain, they said masturbating would also lose you a bunch of IQ points. And the wrong ideas didn't end there. As time went on, people started to think that masturbation wouldn't just cause physical problems, but psychological ones, too. In the 18th and 19th centuries, medical practitioners said masturbation caused disease, maladjustment, and even insanity, which led to some disturbing preventative methods. Like the Victorians used anti-masturbation devices that would hurt the penis if it became erect. You could order one straight out of a catalog. And self-proclaimed experts like Dr. John Harvey Kellogg came up with other gruesome ideas that are such nightmare fuel. I'll spare you the details. His least horrible idea probably that tasteless fiberbridge foods would keep the masses from masturbating, which is part of why he invented corn flakes. No thank you. Yeah, that Kellogg. These days, there's no evidence that masturbating will hurt your SAT scores or that it causes psychological issues. But unfortunately, some new myths have popped up in the last couple of years. Movements like no fap and no nut November encourage men in particular to abstain from masturbation because of the idea that not masturbating can lead to benefits like increased testosterone long-term, which to be clear has no scientific support. The big takeaway, masturbation is a normal part of human sexuality. And there's no need to feel embarrassed about it. No one's going to go blind or bald or grow hair on their palms. Not from marching the penguin or cuffing the carrot or turning on the sprinklers. I can keep them coming, too. Next time, we are wrapping up the series by exploring what it means to be kinky.

it turns out people haven't always been cy about masturbation. back in the timeline, people openly acknowledged it more, including in creation stories. like the ancient sumerians believe one of their gods created the tigris and euphrates rivers by ejaculating. and the ancient egyptians believe that one of their gods created the entire universe by masturbating. now, that's some bde. the ancient greeks saw masturbation as a normal bodily function, but for them, it did have a judgy edge to it. it was seen as something for lowerass citizens, and they weren't the last to give masturbation some side eye. many religions take a negative view of self-pleasure for different reasons. some see masturbation as an expression of lust, while others teach that sex is something a person should only do with their spouse. but some of the shade has also come from historical doctors and scientists whose inaccurate ideas have bled over into the 21st century. for instance, in the 1700s, a famous swiss doctor named samuel ugus tiso popularized the idea that semen was quote a vital fluid that shouldn't be wasted on anything but procreation. in what turned into a global campaign, he and other doctors spread the belief that masturbation made you weak and infertile. and because back then people thought semen originated in the brain, they said masturbating would also lose you a bunch of iq points. and the wrong ideas didn't end there. as time went on, people started to think that masturbation wouldn't just cause physical problems, but psychological ones, too. in the 18th and 19th centuries, medical practitioners said masturbation caused disease, maladjustment, and even insanity, which led to some disturbing preventative methods. like the victorians used anti-masturbation devices that would hurt the penis if it became erect. you could order one straight out of a catalog. and self-proclaimed experts like dr. john harvey kellogg came up with other gruesome ideas that are such nightmare fuel. i'll spare you the details. his least horrible idea probably that tasteless fiberbridge foods would keep the masses from masturbating, which is part of why he invented corn flakes. no thank you. yeah, that kellogg. these days, there's no evidence that masturbating will hurt your sat scores or that it causes psychological issues. but unfortunately, some new myths have popped up in the last couple of years. movements like no fap and no nut november encourage men in particular to abstain from masturbation because of the idea that not masturbating can lead to benefits like increased testosterone long-term, which to be clear has no scientific support. the big takeaway, masturbation is a normal part of human sexuality. and there's no need to feel embarrassed about it. no one's going to go blind or bald or grow hair on their palms. not from marching the penguin or cuffing the carrot or turning on the sprinklers. i can keep them coming, too. next time, we are wrapping up the series by exploring what it means to be kinky. we'll see you then. this episode of crash course sexed was produced in partnership with the kinsey institute at indiana university. if you are interested in learning more, visit their website for resources that explore the topics we discussed in the video today. thank you for watching this episode which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis and was made with the help of all of these very awesome people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone forever, you can join our community on patreon.",8403,1422

That's all true, but at Native American sites, we've also discovered dice made from animal bones, and pottery shards, sticks with pockets, and leather covered balls used for games of, you guessed it, stick ball. Ancient Nerf guns. Well, sort of. In short, things made for fun. These artifacts show us how natives viewed and interacted with the world thousands of years ago and help connect ancestors from the past to natives today. Hi, I'm Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [Music] I'll be the first to say that not all Native people are the same. We all have different tribal affiliations, different traditions, a different taste in Pop-Tarts, minus the cinnamon one. But there are aspects of being native that bring us all together. ways native peoples have viewed the world since time immemorial that tie us to our ancestors. And understanding native worldview can bring us all closer to seeing each other as nuanced, complex people and not just stereotypes. Like if you believe everything the media tells you, you'd think all Native Americans were stoic and serious, always serving resting indigenous face and spouting some next level wisdom with a single tear streaming down their cheek. But really, humor and fun have been parts of native culture and worldview for generations. I mean, how else do you think I became a comedian? It's in my jeans. Those kids-sized weapons I mentioned earlier weren't just for teaching practical hunting skills. They were toys. Native kids in the past would have used these mini weapons in games that taught cooperation and conflict resolution while building relationships and having fun. Native kids do the same thing today. I learned a lot from crushing my cousins at paintball. Natives have long considered laughter to be what we call good medicine or anything that promotes the healing or well-being of mind, body, or spirit, often all three. To understand native humor is to get a good glimpse into native world views. As Vine Delora Jr., a historian and activist of the Standing Rock Sue tribe once wrote, ""One of the best ways to understand a people is to know what makes them laugh. Laughter encompasses the limits of the soul."" Native humor is often dark, satirical, cheeky, and provocative. Abnaki writer Joseph Brochack notes that humor and teasing can be used to remind people that they aren't better than anyone else. And writer Tiffany Mitch, a member of the Standing Rock Sue Nation, tells a story of laughing with her dying mother when trying to figure out what to do with her remains. That conversation led to the title of her book, Bury My Heart at Chuck-E-Cheese's. You know, human remains probably weren't the weirdest thing that you would find at Chuck-E-Cheese when I was a kid. That ball pit was full of secrets. And for natives, humor wasn't just for fun. It was a way to create community and bond the way people do when they share inside jokes or roast someone on their tribe's private Facebook page or text memes back and forth. Personally, this is my favorite. Many tribes, like the PBLO people, even consider humor to be sacred. Some of their ceremonies feature sacred clowns called kosharis who are painted in black and white and act out bad behaviors like gluttony or laziness to teach the community about what not to do. There might be some light reticule in there too if you haven't been on your agame lately. And kosharis aren't just funny. They have natural powers like the ability to bring rain. In the past, many Christian missionaries and anthropologists documented different variations of native clowns or tricksters, but they usually didn't get the joke, especially because clowns would often make fun of the European colonizers themselves. Self-awareness not to settle their strong suit. Those clowns were part of a centuries long tradition of natives using humor to cope and build resilience, finding ways to laugh about tough stuff like colonization and persecution. Because if you can't make fun of the colonizers, who can you make fun of? The confusion white colonizers felt when trying to interpret native humor has shown up in books, movies, and TV shows where indigenous representation was for so long a product of white imaginations, often depicting native people as vicious, violent, and humorless and covered in war paint 24/7. And like we talked about in episode 3, those inaccurate and stereotypical representations of natives have real consequences, impacting everything from how natives are treated by police and the courts to the mental health of native youth and much more. But accurate nativeled representations fight against that. These days, popular TV shows are bringing native comedic traditions to a wider audience. like the show's reservation dogs and Rutherford Falls were either made up by or with the help of indigenous creators and much of the worldview represented in them comes from actual lived native experiences. I can watch these shows and be like, ""Yep, they get me."" And then there are folks like me, indigenous content creators bringing native humor to millions of people online. Humor like this. [Music] Dakota and Da actor, comedian, and activist Dallas Goldtooth has said that humor can also be an important tool in reclaiming power from oppressors by letting that joy fuel action. By the way, Goldtooth is a member of the 1491s, a native sketch comedy group who posts short online videos and appears in both Reservation Dogs and Ritherford Falls. What's the native equivalent of a Renaissance man? a renaissance man. For Goldtooth and many natives, the ability to laugh at our oppressors and poke fun at serious things helps take back a little bit of power from those hierarchies and return it to the natives. Cuz it turns out fun and games have a lot of power. For example, a spear throwing game called Chunky may have been used to hash out diplomatic relationships between tribes like Fortnite, but instead of ruining friendships, it strengthens them. While conflict and war were common among native nations before Europeans arrived, their diplomatic practices also showcase another important part of native worldview. Reciprocity or interdependence between people and all living and non-living things. Another way to think of it is I take care of you and you take care of me. And when it comes to relationships with other tribes, peace was good for trade and trade was good for survival. Let me tell you a story about one of the most famous alliances in native history. Generations ago, five nations were at war with each other. A tribal leader named Toddaho had murdered the wife and daughter of another leader, Hayawenta. But one day, a man called Peacemaker, who wanted to spread peace and unity among the nations, visited Haywenta and helped him let go of his anchor. As the story goes, Peacemaker snapped an arrow in half and showed how easy it was to break. Then he tied five arrows together and tried again, but the arrows held firm. They were stronger together. So peacemaker and Hayawena demonstrated this strength to Tatadaho who agreed to join them under the great law of peace. The five nations that came together as a result became known as the Hnesoni or the Irakcoy Confederacy. An alliance among the Mohawk, Cynica, Onida, Anadaga, and Kauga nations. Later the Tuscarora would join bringing their ranks to six. The Tuscarora were running on Indian time. To celebrate their unity, the Honosi dug up a white pine tree and threw their weapons in the hole. And then they planted a new tree above that hole and named it the tree of peace. And that's the story of Peacemaker. Delicious. The story of Peacemaker demonstrates the strength of native interdependence. We can see this value in the popular native phrase all my relations in lot oasan. The idea of all my relations is that everything not just ourselves is part of the same great tapestry of the universe. This dude is my cousin spiritually speaking. And reciprocity doesn't just extend to people but to all living things including plants and animals and even natural elements like fire and wind. In fact, the land is so important to native cultures that we made a whole episode about it. And there are lots of ways to express that give and take relationship with it, like saying a prayer after a hunt or returning an animal's bones to the land or not fracking. Or there's the tradition of the honorable harvest. This is a way of harvesting plants for medicinal, cultural, and food purposes that seeks to use the earth's resources respectfully and gratefully. While there are variations from nation to nation, overall the idea is to ask for permission before harvesting and only take what's necessary while making sure there's plenty left behind. Pretty much the OG reduce, reuse, recycle. After harvesting, the community can show their gratitude by saying a prayer or reciprocating the gift through giving and offering and caring for the land so the plants can continue to grow. That reciprocity and gratitude also extends to the way native communities view wealth. For example, one traditional gathering is called the pot latch, originating from the Chinuk Wawwa term meaning to gift or give. It is much more than just a gathering. It is a way of understanding the world. The practice, which is still used today, is rooted in honoring relationships with fellow humans and with the earth through reciprocity. It is an economic and legal system that redistributes material and intangible wealth as a way to honor debts. Palatches maintain a system of existence based on honoring the whole above the self. These and other ceremonies are important ways of gathering together in community and they can bring together all these different values. Gratitude, respect, generosity, humor to preserve native culture and further bond us together. These values also show up in the ways many tribes are structured through systems of kinship or family ties. The Cheyenne, in particular, have a strict structure of kinship, though humor is a big part of it, too. Certain family relationships, especially the in-laws, are expected to tease and joke with each other to maintain harmony, and the health and balance of the family unit directly influences the health and the balance of the tribal band and the Cheyenne nation as a whole. The history of Native Americans has often been overshadowed by the arrival of Europeans and the subsequent generations of mistreatment and cultural destruction. But to bring it back to my boy Peacemaker, we're stronger together. Native worldviews and all their complexity, depth, and diversity derive from thousands of years of history and tradition. And generations of playing games, making peace, sharing feast, joking about death, and making fun of ourselves and our oppressors have built a foundation for tribal strength and perseverance today. Next time we're going to explore the complicated history between Native Americans and Archaeology, and I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-06-12,2025,567,9.45,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edsqqXrIK1k,"Orgasms. They're the shining light at the end of the sexy tunnel. I see it. I like it. I want it. I got it. Except it's not that simple. We tend to put orgasms on a pedestal as the pinnacle of sexual experience, but there's a lot more to doing it than the big O. Hi, I'm Shamboo Dram and this is Crash Course [Music] Sexed. First, a note on language. Most orgasm research focuses on cisgender people, aka guys with penises and ladies with vaginas. So, when we refer to men and women in this episode, those are the groups that we're talking about. Humans have always been more diverse than that, but there's not much research yet on trans, interex, and non-binary experiences. So, with the science we have now, let's get into it. An orgasm is the sudden involuntary release of sexual tension. You get aroused. There's usually some kind of physical action. And eventually all that tension releases with a bunch of super nice contractions and a rush of feel-good chemicals in your brain. But behind that simple description is a lot of complexity. Like sometimes an orgasm just involves the star players. Men mostly orgasm from stimulation of the penis while women mostly orgasm from stimulation of the clitoris either internally or externally. And if you just said, ""Huh?"" That's your cue to watch episode 2. But there's a whole supporting cast of characters. Lots of people can experience pleasure and even orgasm from nipple or anal stimulation because both share proximity to the genitals either in the brain or on the body. And both have a lot of nerve endings. Men also have the prostate, a gland about the size of a walnut that sits a couple inches inside the rectum. Some people find that stimulating it can be a really nice time. Overall though, pretty much any part of the body can be an arogynous zone, an area that can trigger sexual arousal. And what gets someone going is pretty unique to them. It can be the nipples, thighs, neck, ears, hands, feet, you name it. Some people can even have an orgasm just by thinking sexy thoughts. How's that for DIY? And after an orgasm, it might be a few minutes or hours before you can go at it again, especially for men. Scientists even have a name for this downtime, the refractory period. All said, there are a lot of ways to orgasm. It all depends on what works for you. What about the G-spot? My friend's cousin's neighbor, they told me all about it, and it's supposed to be the way to, you know. Good question, Teenshan. First of all, despite what past experts and friends, cousins, neighbors say, there's no ultimate orgasm because there's no way of measuring the many dimensions that make up pleasure. And when it comes to the infamous G-spot, that arrogynous zone inside the vagina, turns out researchers can't really agree on exactly what or where it is. The G-spot's probably not a magic orgasm button, but another form of internal clitoreral stimulation. As for how we learned all this stuff, we owe much of what we know to the research duo William Masters and Virginia Johnson. They were a gynecologist and a sexologist at Washington University in St. Louis, famous for their in-depth research on human sexuality. Teen Chan, let them know. It was 1957 and Masters and Johnson were trying really hard to make their research not seem sexy because they needed funding to study orgasms, which weren't exactly all the rage at the time. Fortunately, they got their coin and set up a research lab to observe people having orgasms with the help of a penis camera. A what? You heard me. Women who agreed to be the subjects would essentially use it to masturbate and it would record video of what was happening inside their vaginas. Masters and Johnson learned tons of stuff from observing hundreds of women, especially about how different parts of the vagina and vulva react during orgasm. And one of their most notable findings was a model they called the human sexual response cycle. A road map for how bodies respond to sexual stimuli broken down into four stages: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. At the time, medical journals weren't willing to publish their research. So, in 1966, Masters and Johnson published them in their own book instead. And after a lot of hate mail, human sexual response eventually became a bestseller. The human sexual response cycle was revolutionary for its time, although it did have some gaps. Like, what about desire? What makes someone want to have sex in the first place? And what if someone's sexual response doesn't follow this cycle? Masters and Johnson theorized that these four stages work the same for everybody. But since then, we've learned about some key differences in how men and women orgasm. Also, we've learned that orgasm isn't all about the physical. There are social aspects at play, too. One of the more recent models that takes these nuances into account is called the dual control model, developed at the Kinsey Institute in the 1990s by sexologist John Braftoft and Eric Jansen. This model says every individual has their own set of offs and ons like the brakes and accelerators on a car. Your ons might be physical, like someone kissing you just right. Or they might be social. Maybe your partner wore something attractive, smelled good, or did something nice for you that wasn't sexual at all. Maybe they just got the riz. Similarly, your offs can be physicals, or they can be less tangible. Maybe you're tired, or maybe you can't get the dog to leave the bedroom, and it really feels like they're just staring at you. These two control systems work in tandem throughout the whole sexual experience, determining if you want to have sex, if you can reach orgasm, and how that experience of the orgasm makes you feel. And because humans are a lot more complex than wiener mobiles, everyone's brakes accelerators are different. When it comes to sex and gender differences, there is some evidence to support that women tend to have more sensitive brakes and men tend to have more sensitive accelerators, but those are just averages. In this study, these differences varied more from person to person of the same gender than they did between men and women. That said, we got to talk about the gap. And I don't mean the store that your mom used to buy your basic tees from. Data shows that men are more likely than women to orgasm during heterosexual sex. In one US-based study of more than 50,000 people, 95% of straight men said that they usually are always orgasm during sex, while only 65% of straight women said they do. This gendered discrepancy is called the orgasm gap. On one hand, it could be related to differences in anatomy, including the location of nerve endings and the fact that it's pretty easy to stimulate the penis compared to the smaller and largely internal clitoris. But social and cultural attitudes play a role, too. Sexual scripts, those social expectations about how to behave when it comes to sex, can influence whose sexual pleasure gets prioritized. Like, men often just need PNV sex to have an orgasm. But 80% of the straight women in that 50,000 person survey said they usually are always orgasmed when they combine PNV sex with other types of intimacy like deep kissing, genital stimulation, or oral sex. And in Western culture, sexual scripts that stigmatize women's sexual pleasure can make partners less likely to engage in the kind of stimulation that helps women orgasm. Those same sexual scripts can be reinforced in sex scenes in movies, TV shows, and porn, which often show women orgasming from penetrative sex alone. Like in a 2018 study of 50 popular porn videos, almost half of female orgasms came from PNV sex. Seeing these kinds of representations can lead women to think they're supposed to orgasm this way and fake orgasms with their partner if it isn't naturally happening. Luckily, studies have shed some light on what seems to help reduce the orgasm gap. One is knowing about the clitoris and how it works. And two is ditching those sexual scripts that tell women their pleasure matters less than men's. In a 2022 survey, researchers found that for women, both of those things together were related to a better time in the bedroom. Orgasms can be great, but they don't have to be the crown jewel of sex. Just because someone didn't orgasm doesn't mean they had a bad time. You can explore pleasure for pleasure's sake and connect with your partner with no end goal in mind. Like sometimes I just want to drink a nice cup of tea. If a caffeine rush hits me, great. But if not, I still had a lovely cupa. Orgasms can happen in a lot of different ways. All bodies have the potential for pleasure. But scientists are still learning about how orgasms work, especially outside of cisgender straight relationships. And while we haven't quite yet reached orgasm equality, some good ways to have more of them are by communicating with sexual partners and experimenting to find what feels good for you. We'll keep this conversation going in next week's episode on masturbation. See you then.

Maybe it's a lake where you played as a kid, or a field that glitters at dusk, or a neighborhood where you know every street by heart. Now, imagine that connection you feel goes even deeper. Imagine it's embedded in your language, your relative stories, your traditions, and it's a connection stretching back generations longer than anyone can remember. That's just a taste of what it means when Native Americans talk about being connected to a place. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and this is Crash Course Native American [Music] History. When Native Americans talk about a connection to a place, it usually goes a lot deeper than I'm from LA or I'm from Chicago. Many Native nations like the Yuki of what's now California have continuously lived in the same place for thousands of years. Others, like the Cherokee, still feel connected to their homeland, even though they no longer live there. The Cherokee lived for generations in what's now the southeastern United States until the 19th century when the federal government violently removed them from those lands and forced them to move to present day Oklahoma. But this connection is about more than just the physical land. Like, yeah, it's made of trees and rocks, but also water, sky, other plants and animals, forces like thunder and wind, seasons and stars. Natives view all these elements as part of a living breathing hole that humans aren't separate from. And this worldview stretches across different native nations and cultures. The podawatamy of what's now the Great Lakes region often described the land as mean Goyak, which means that which has been given to us. It's a phrase that invokes every life sustaining thing the land holds that's offered up for free. Sunlight, water, food, shelter, and medicine. The idea that the land takes care of you and in return you take care of it. I think Robin Wall Kimmer a Pawatami botnist said it best. Land is everything. Identity, the connection to our ancestors, the home of our non-human kinfolk, our pharmacy, our library, the source of all that sustained us. It belonged to itself. It was a gift, not a commodity, so it could never be bought or sold. She's got bars. And we see this perspective in many native traditions like every June on the coast of what's now Washington, salmon emerge from the ocean and swim into the freshwater rivers. The coast sish people describe this as part of a sacred agreement. Salmon come into the rivers, offering themselves as food for people. But in return, people must care for salmon by cleaning the rivers, greeting the first salmon, and returning that salmon's bones back to the water. And every year during the first salmon ceremony, that's exactly what co- Salish people do, gathering to sing, dance, and pray to hold up their end of the bargain. Or like some tribes in what's now California, weave baskets from native grasses, twigs, roots, and ferns. The designs they create tell traditional stories of their homeland. To this day, people who practice this tradition literally weave their ties to the land into their creations. Many native languages also reveal these close ties with nature. Lucid, for example, is spoken by many coast sus tribes from the area that's now called the Pusian sound. These groups share the perspective that every part of the land has a voice and often it's called its own name. Like that's crow. There's stol which means river that comes from the sound of water pouring over rocks. and clutch which means salt water and calls to the mind waves washing up on the beach. So sometimes native languages sound like the land but often they share ideas about the land too like the word onaban gizus in the Ojiway language is one way to refer to the month of March but really it refers to the hard crust on the snow moon. the moon or month where the top layer of the snow melts during the day and then freezes at night. Or when the honosy count from 1 to 10, they're not just counting, they're also telling their story of how the land came into existence and reaffirming their ties to it. Like the word for one is also the word for Skywoman who arrived first in their creation story. The word for two refers to Skywoman's daughter who came next. And the word for three refers to Skywoman's daughter and her twin grandsons. All these connections exist on a mind-blowing time scale. So ancient it's often described as since time immemorial. In other words, so long ago is before any record or memory. I'm talking about connections that go all the way back to Native Americans ancestors. Ancestors ancestors. Ancestors ancestors. Ancestors. Ancestors. Ancestor ancestor. They've had thousands of years to simmer. The US origin story often makes it seem like Europeans stumbled on an untamed wilderness and that it was fine, noble even, to claim this barely touched place, but that just wasn't true. North America was very much occupied. John Green. This will do. [Music] In 2023, researchers confirmed that human footprints preserved in the mud in what's now New Mexico were as many as 23,000 years old, thousands of years before Europeans came. The land here teamed with life. Native villages, farms, nations, and confederations of nations. Some groups settled in one place. Others moved with the seasons, and trade networks spread across the continent, connecting different nations through trails and waterways. Like over 1600 years ago, indigenous people living in what's now Ohio built the Hopewell Earth Works. Enormous earthn mounds formed into precise geometric shapes and they transported goods to the ceremonial site from all over what's now North America like obsidian rock from what's now Idaho and seashells and fossilized megalodon teeth from the Gulf Coast. Everywhere they went, natives developed highly specialized way of living with the land. like the Ashue or the Zouri in what's now New Mexico invented a way of farming in a place where it hardly rains at all using moisture trapping grids and Hata of what's now North Dakota spent part of their year growing food on Primo riverfronts. Then when the river flooded every year, they moved around and hunted knowing the soil would be turbo boosted with nutrients by the time they returned. Work smarter, not harder. My point is this place was lived in. There was deep active relationships between native people and the elements of the land around them. Natives managed the landscape, clearing, planting, hunting, fishing, and building. And they knew their stuff. For example, tribal nations across the continent used fire as a tool, burning smaller patches of land to boost the growth of certain plants and prevent much larger wildfires. Some scholars even argue that native people even molded the environment in ways that other living things depended on. And native people depended on those living things right back. But then Europeans came knocking, carrying diseases that ballooned into epidemics. They also brought invasive species like rats that had no natural predators, making life harder for native species. I mean, I'm not saying colonists were an invasive species, but and of course, they also brought colonialism, that system where one group of people dominates and subjugates another. They also brought a hunger for land. As colonists kept flowing in and that hunger grew, so did efforts to remove native people from their land and claim those lands for themselves. Many tribes were forced into reservations and then many of those lands were split into aotments assigned to individual tribal members. But aotments just shrank tribal lands further so that non-native people could swoop in and claim more of it for their own. Today, at least much of the Western world, it's property that gets treated as sacred, not the land itself. And because of this dominant worldview, many native communities have been separated from the land they've been in relationship with since time immemorial, including sacred sites. Thankfully, many native communities are reclaiming stewardship of their ancestral homelands, striving to heal places that had been harmed and care for them like they deserve to be cared for. For example, in the 18th and 19th centuries, over 2 million acres in what's now New York were taken from the Anadaga nation, including Anadaga Lake. The Anadaga consider that lake sacred, but it's been abused, used, and polluted with toxic waste in the past hundred years. But in 2022, 1,000 acres of that forest were put back under the Anadaga Nation stewardship, including the headwaters of the creek that flows into that lake. For thousands of years, the Anadaga cared for these waters like relatives, and now they're back in the family. And in recent years, about onethird of the land that was taken from the Bakoj or Iowa tribe has been transferred back to tribal ownership. They've turned the land into a tribal national park that can be used for hiking and camping and will preserve the land and stories of the Iowa people for future generations. As landsets return to native stewardship, populations of bison, eagles, trumpeter swans, and herring are being restored, invasive species eliminated, and habitats in grasslands, forests, and rivers revived in regions from present day Montana to Virginia. From a native perspective, the land is so much more than what we see and touch. It's everything. Our home, our responsibility, the source of sustenance for our bodies and spirits, and part of our identity. For many native people, restoring land to native stewardship serves as an acknowledgement of native peoples ourselves, a step towards ensuring tribal sovereignty. For native youth, it's a step towards the future. Native Americans have thousands of years of experience taking care of the land, and that responsibility and knowledge gets passed on from generation to generation. As Iowa Tribal Vice Chairman Lance Foster said, ""We've been here for a thousand years now, and unlike other people who can buy and sell land and move away, we can never move away. This is our land forever. Here's to the next thousand years."" In our next episode, we're going to unpack some common aspects of Native Worldviews, and I will see you then.

[Music]",why land matters to native americans  ep 5 of crash course native american history,"think of a place that's important to you. maybe it's a lake where you played as a kid, or a field that glitters at dusk, or a neighborhood where you know every street by heart. now, imagine that connection you feel goes even deeper. imagine it's embedded in your language, your relative stories, your traditions, and it's a connection stretching back generations longer than anyone can remember. that's just a taste of what it means when native americans talk about being connected to a place. hi, i'm jay jim and this is crash course native american  music  history. when native americans talk about a connection to a place, it usually goes a lot deeper than i'm from la or i'm from chicago. many native nations like the yuki of what's now california have continuously lived in the same place for thousands of years. others, like the cherokee, still feel connected to their homeland, even though they no longer live there. the cherokee lived for generations in what's now the southeastern united states until the 19th century when the federal government violently removed them from those lands and forced them to move to present day oklahoma. but this connection is about more than just the physical land. like, yeah, it's made of trees and rocks, but also water, sky, other plants and animals, forces like thunder and wind, seasons and stars. natives view all these elements as part of a living breathing hole that humans aren't separate from. and this worldview stretches across different native nations and cultures. the podawatamy of what's now the great lakes region often described the land as mean goyak, which means that which has been given to us. it's a phrase that invokes every life sustaining thing the land holds that's offered up for free. sunlight, water, food, shelter, and medicine. the idea that the land takes care of you and in return you take care of it. i think robin wall kimmer a pawatami botnist said it best. land is everything. identity, the connection to our ancestors, the home of our non-human kinfolk, our pharmacy, our library, the source of all that sustained us. it belonged to itself. it was a gift, not a commodity, so it could never be bought or sold. she's got bars. and we see this perspective in many native traditions like every june on the coast of what's now washington, salmon emerge from the ocean and swim into the freshwater rivers. the coast sish people describe this as part of a sacred agreement. salmon come into the rivers, offering themselves as food for people. but in return, people must care for salmon by cleaning the rivers, greeting the first salmon, and returning that salmon's bones back to the water. and every year during the first salmon ceremony, that's exactly what co- salish people do, gathering to sing, dance, and pray to hold up their end of the bargain. or like some tribes in what's now california, weave baskets from native grasses, twigs, roots, and ferns. the designs they create tell traditional stories of their homeland. to this day, people who practice this tradition literally weave their ties to the land into their creations. many native languages also reveal these close ties with nature. lucid, for example, is spoken by many coast sus tribes from the area that's now called the pusian sound. these groups share the perspective that every part of the land has a voice and often it's called its own name. like that's crow. there's stol which means river that comes from the sound of water pouring over rocks. and clutch which means salt water and calls to the mind waves washing up on the beach. so sometimes native languages sound like the land but often they share ideas about the land too like the word onaban gizus in the ojiway language is one way to refer to the month of march but really it refers to the hard crust on the snow moon. the moon or month where the top layer of the snow melts during the day and then freezes at night. or when the honosy count from 1 to 10, they're not just counting, they're also telling their story of how the land came into existence and reaffirming their ties to it. like the word for one is also the word for skywoman who arrived first in their creation story. the word for two refers to skywoman's daughter who came next. and the word for three refers to skywoman's daughter and her twin grandsons. all these connections exist on a mind-blowing time scale. so ancient it's often described as since time immemorial. in other words, so long ago is before any record or memory. i'm talking about connections that go all the way back to native americans ancestors. ancestors ancestors. ancestors ancestors. ancestors. ancestors. ancestor ancestor. they've had thousands of years to simmer. the us origin story often makes it seem like europeans stumbled on an untamed wilderness and that it was fine, noble even, to claim this barely touched place, but that just wasn't true. north america was very much occupied. john green. this will do.  music  in 2023, researchers confirmed that human footprints preserved in the mud in what's now new mexico were as many as 23,000 years old, thousands of years before europeans came. the land here teamed with life. native villages, farms, nations, and confederations of nations. some groups settled in one place. others moved with the seasons, and trade networks spread across the continent, connecting different nations through trails and waterways. like over 1600 years ago, indigenous people living in what's now ohio built the hopewell earth works. enormous earthn mounds formed into precise geometric shapes and they transported goods to the ceremonial site from all over what's now north america like obsidian rock from what's now idaho and seashells and fossilized megalodon teeth from the gulf coast. everywhere they went, natives developed highly specialized way of living with the land. like the ashue or the zouri in what's now new mexico invented a way of farming in a place where it hardly rains at all using moisture trapping grids and hata of what's now north dakota spent part of their year growing food on primo riverfronts. then when the river flooded every year, they moved around and hunted knowing the soil would be turbo boosted with nutrients by the time they returned. work smarter, not harder. my point is this place was lived in. there was deep active relationships between native people and the elements of the land around them. natives managed the landscape, clearing, planting, hunting, fishing, and building. and they knew their stuff. for example, tribal nations across the continent used fire as a tool, burning smaller patches of land to boost the growth of certain plants and prevent much larger wildfires. some scholars even argue that native people even molded the environment in ways that other living things depended on. and native people depended on those living things right back. but then europeans came knocking, carrying diseases that ballooned into epidemics. they also brought invasive species like rats that had no natural predators, making life harder for native species. i mean, i'm not saying colonists were an invasive species, but and of course, they also brought colonialism, that system where one group of people dominates and subjugates another. they also brought a hunger for land. as colonists kept flowing in and that hunger grew, so did efforts to remove native people from their land and claim those lands for themselves. many tribes were forced into reservations and then many of those lands were split into aotments assigned to individual tribal members. but aotments just shrank tribal lands further so that non-native people could swoop in and claim more of it for their own. today, at least much of the western world, it's property that gets treated as sacred, not the land itself. and because of this dominant worldview, many native communities have been separated from the land they've been in relationship with since time immemorial, including sacred sites. thankfully, many native communities are reclaiming stewardship of their ancestral homelands, striving to heal places that had been harmed and care for them like they deserve to be cared for. for example, in the 18th and 19th centuries, over 2 million acres in what's now new york were taken from the anadaga nation, including anadaga lake. the anadaga consider that lake sacred, but it's been abused, used, and polluted with toxic waste in the past hundred years. but in 2022, 1,000 acres of that forest were put back under the anadaga nation stewardship, including the headwaters of the creek that flows into that lake. for thousands of years, the anadaga cared for these waters like relatives, and now they're back in the family. and in recent years, about onethird of the land that was taken from the bakoj or iowa tribe has been transferred back to tribal ownership. they've turned the land into a tribal national park that can be used for hiking and camping and will preserve the land and stories of the iowa people for future generations. as landsets return to native stewardship, populations of bison, eagles, trumpeter swans, and herring are being restored, invasive species eliminated, and habitats in grasslands, forests, and rivers revived in regions from present day montana to virginia. from a native perspective, the land is so much more than what we see and touch. it's everything. our home, our responsibility, the

Whether you went looking for it, a friend shoved a video under your nose, or you got a sketchy DM, it's hard not to come across porn in our extremely online world. Either way, your first encounter with porn might have piqued your curiosity, or it might have even disturbed you. It's okay. We're going to unpack all of that together. Hi, I'm Sham Budram and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. Heads up. In today's video, we'll be discussing a sensitive topic, including sexual assault and descriptions of certain kinds of sex acts. So, please keep that in mind and take care when watching. We learn about sex from a lot of different sources, but nobody seems to want to admit that for a lot of people, one of their biggest teachers is pornography. Videos, films, magazines, and other forms of media that are meant for sexual arousal. No matter what popped into your head when I first said porn, the word has a pretty broad definition because what's considered arousing can really vary from person to person. In a Supreme Court case about which sexual material was obscene enough to censor, one of the justices said porn was hard to define, but I know it when I see it. Whatever it is, porn is a part of our society. Like one survey from 2022 found that 73% of teenagers may have seen porn online, many before the age of 13. despite the rise of age restriction laws that require viewers to be 18 or older. Well, I definitely don't watch porn. Girl, I'm you. I know you're lying, but I don't blame you. Cuz here's the thing. The way sex classes and the adults in our lives talk about porn, if they do at all, is often full of shame. And that leaves people with a sense that they shouldn't ask questions. But it turns out one of the best ways to responsibly engage with porn is by getting curious. The first thing to know, images that we might consider pornographic today have been around forever. Peruvian sex pods sculpted 1500 years ago. Fresco from first century Pompei, 17th century erotic Japanese paintings. Images of naked people doing sexy stuff have been around for a long time. Although whether an image was considered pornographic generally depended on the viewer's cultural background, European archaeologists were often the ones claiming that these images were obscene without understanding their cultural context. And people haven't just used explicit material to get all hot and bothered in 18th century Europe. They also used it to spread elicit information about contraception and women's sexual freedom and to poke fun at the aristocracy. Add this to the fact that porn was seen as depraved and you can see why its creators were often punished with jail time. But that didn't stop people from making more. As time went on and photography and film were invented, visual porn became super popular. And these days, the internet is home to more sexually explicit material than your great great great great great grandparents could have ever imagined. So yes, porn is not new, but what is new is the sheer amount and accessibility of it that we get from the internet. And that comes with some benefits and some downsides. On the positive side, consuming porn and even sexy scenes in regular old TV shows and movies may help to stigmatize sex and provide people with a space to explore their sexuality, especially if information about that kind of thing isn't available in their IRL communities. This can be particularly true for members of the LGBTQ plus community. Remember how the Q can stand for questioning? Porn can help those folks figure out what they find sexy. In fact, because education about anything but penis and vagina sex is hard to come by, young LGBTQ plus people often learn the nuts and bolts of sex from porn. Ultimately, everyone's relationship with porn is different. But truth be told, porn isn't all fun and games either. One of the main reasons, most of it is not realistic. No matter how amateur the footage looks, the vast majority of video porn is staged for the screen, and the people involved are performers. But that can be hard to remember if we just accept what happens in those scenes at face value. It can lead us to picking up warped ideas about what sex should look like or what we should look like. Multiple studies have found that the usually thin, hairless women and chiseled dudes in porn can make young people feel bad about their bodies, just like airbrushed Instagram models or gym bro Tik Tockers can. And when it comes to the experience of sex in pornographic videos, performers often fake orgasms because again, they're performing. What? They fake orgasms? I mean, I I wouldn't know. I don't watch porn. Okay. Yeah, TJ. They do fake orgasms, and this can give viewers the false idea that everyone's going to respond the same way to certain sex acts and make them wonder if something's wrong with them when it doesn't play out that way. And one of the most unrealistic parts of most porn videos is that they don't talk about the important stuff. A lot of the time they're just naked people on a bed and they start doing stuff. No consent, no communication about desires, and no protection. People with penises often don't wear condoms in porn, let alone have a conversation about wearing one. But in reality, talking to each other is one of the key ways to have good sex. Many researchers and educators also raised red flags about the amount of violence and non-consensual aggression on popular porn sites, especially because they can reflect harmful attitudes about women and especially women of color. In a 2020 study of over 4,000 porn scenes, 35 to 45% showed violence with women being the target 97% of the time. Another study showed that black women were even more likely than white women to be shown as the victims of violence. And black men were shown as the aggressors more often than white men. And the thing about the internet is you don't even have to click on these videos to see the thumbnails and titles that use racial stereotypes and misogyny. Historically, exploitation of performers has been a major part of the industry, too. This is a complex issue that we won't dive into today, but know that many people who watch porn are getting more interested in how to do so ethically. Now, as far as the research goes, there's no conclusive evidence about whether watching violent or misogynistic porn makes someone more likely to act that way offline. Some research, including a survey from 2019, found that respondents who viewed violent porn were more likely to have perpetrated sexual violence, but that doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other. An emerging research, including one study that surveyed almost 5,000 American college students, has found that choking, an act popularized by video porn and other media like Euphoria, has increased among young adults, despite the fact that it's not a safe thing to do, even when it's consensual. But long-term research is also sparse, and different definitions of porn make it hard to compare findings. And when it comes to misogyny, a lot of studies are at odds. Some say that watching porn is correlated with having sexist attitudes, while some say the opposite. Also, scientists still don't really know what high exposure to porn does to our brains. If you want to learn more about the research that does exist, you can visit our friends over at Sihow. One way or another, though, porn is still everywhere. So, what do we do with that? The key is to think critically about what we see in porn and to make smart decisions about it. A little thing called porn literacy. Porn literacy is part of sexual literacy, the critical thinking skills needed to have good sexual health, and it's not all that different from media literacy. It involves a lot of the same concepts and skills you'd use to identify the biases behind a news article or figure out if a photo was made by AI. It also involves unpacking the assumptions we adopt from porn so that we don't spread misinformation or bring harmful behaviors or ideas into our sex lives. Like, if you don't see people wearing condoms or talking about contraception or STI in porn, what message is that sending you? So, here are some questions you can ask yourself when you come across a piece of pornographic media. One, how does this make me feel? Two, what is this trying to get me to think about sex or people? Three, what about this might not be true to life? Four, what's missing from this piece of media? And five, what sources of information can I trust about the stuff I'm seeing here? That last question might be the trickiest, but it's an important one. We all know we shouldn't believe everything you see on the internet, but that is where we get a lot of our information. And some online sources are better than others. Some reference research from doctors, sex therapists, and scientific journals, while others, well, you probably seen some of those Tik Toks. Also, it's worth noting that these critical thinking skills don't just apply to explicit videos. You can use these questions to analyze any information about sex you encounter, from TV and movies to fanfiction and spicy romance novels, or my personal favorite medium, audio erotica. Cuz the thing is, there's nothing wrong with wanting to explore your sexuality or responsibly seek out pleasure. But like anything else, it's important to make sure we do it in a way that's healthy, safe, and mindful. Ultimately, not everybody watches porn on a regular, and it's certainly not a requirement for a happy sex life. But for those who enjoy it, it's important to think critically about what's being portrayed because in the end, porn is designed to arouse and entertain, but it's not meant to educate. For that, you've got things like Crash Course. Coming up next, we're talking all about orgasms. See you then.

so, here are some questions you can ask yourself when you come across a piece of pornographic media. one, how does this make me feel? two, what is this trying to get me to think about sex or people? three, what about this might not be true to life? four, what's missing from this piece of media? and five, what sources of information can i trust about the stuff i'm seeing here? that last question might be the trickiest, but it's an important one. we all know we shouldn't believe everything you see on the internet, but that is where we get a lot of our information. and some online sources are better than others. some reference research from doctors, sex therapists, and scientific journals, while others, well, you probably seen some of those tik toks. also, it's worth noting that these critical thinking skills don't just apply to explicit videos. you can use these questions to analyze any information about sex you encounter, from tv and movies to fanfiction and spicy romance novels, or my personal favorite medium, audio erotica. cuz the thing is, there's nothing wrong with wanting to explore your sexuality or responsibly seek out pleasure. but like anything else, it's important to make sure we do it in a way that's healthy, safe, and mindful. ultimately, not everybody watches porn on a regular, and it's certainly not a requirement for a happy sex life. but for those who enjoy it, it's important to think critically about what's being portrayed because in the end, porn is designed to arouse and entertain, but it's not meant to educate. for that, you've got things like crash course. coming up next, we're talking all about orgasms. see you then. this episode of crash course sexed was produced in partnership with the kinsey institute at indiana university. if you are interested in learning more, visit their website for resources that explore the topics we discussed in the video today. thank you for watching this episode, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis and was made with the help of all these sexually literate people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone forever, you can join the community on patreon.",10415,1823

There's a misconception that to be truly Native, you have to have darker skin and long hair, dress only in traditional clothing, and be actively riding a horse. But Native Americans are also modern people. We wear suits and jingle dresses, ride coat, and teach traditional languages, rock buzzcuts and braids. We could have an Ojiway mom and a British dad who passed on his blonde hair, pale skin, or love of beans on toast. Basically, you can't tell if someone's native just by looking. So, today I'm going to give you the scoop on what it really means to be native. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American [Music] History. So, first of all, there's no single native identity and no single native culture. Before the land that we call the United States was a twinkle in Thomas Jefferson's eye, some native nations knew this land as Turtle Island, and it was and is a land of hundreds of tribes. Each tribe had its own cultural practices and unique identities with different spiritual beliefs, languages, customs, landscapes, rituals, food, dress, and traditions. You wouldn't get a quacuto potluck confused with a muscoi green corn ceremony. That would be like growing up to single de Mayo in liter hosen. People look at you funny. Trust me. I know. We'll begin in 1492 when Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Whoa. No. No. We won't. Plus, the Vikings made it here way before that dweeb. Anyway, yes. To make an extremely long story short, European settlers colonized North America, interrupting native life. Something we'll talk more about in episode 10. And like we'll see over and over throughout this series, native people are still dealing with the consequences of colonization, including when it comes to identity. Take spirituality. Before colonization, the hundreds of tribes scattered throughout what is now the US had diverse spiritual practices, and many communities shared the notion that all living things are related, a part of a family rather than resources to be used up. what we native folks call mitaku oasi, a lot phrase meaning all my relations. But when the colonists imported Christianity and those weird hats to North America, they tended to see Native Americans as souls in need of saving. Spiritual practices that had stretched back for generations were suddenly disrupted. For instance, the Puritan John Elliot of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, nice ascot, tried to convert American Indians to Christianity. He even learned the Algangquin language to do so and it worked. One quarter of native people in New England converted to Christianity. Elliot isolated those who converted into praying towns, forcing them to cut their hair, dress like Puritans, and give up their families and cultural practices. This created tribal and cultural tensions between those who converted and those who didn't. Even within families, when your community faces a crisis of faith, what does that do to your cultural identity? Fast forward to the 21st century and twothirds of Native Americans today identify as Christian, but plenty of Native people still follow their traditional beliefs and some mix the two. My own grandma wore her traditional dress every day. She spoke fluent Navajo and with the Catholic mass every week or like at Minnesota's All Saints Episcopal Indian Mission where the pastor burns sweetg grass instead of incense. The organ is swapped for traditional drum and the congregation holds annual buffalo roast. And when it comes to cultural identity, language is one of the most powerful ways to share and preserve it. But hundreds of native languages have been lost since European contact in part thanks to American Indian boarding schools. Starting in the 1870s, thousands of native children were forced to attend these government schools and among many other deeply horrifying things were forbidden from using their given names and speaking their languages. We'll talk a lot more about these boarding schools later on in this series, but let's jump forward to the here and now. If you can't speak your ancestral language, how might that affect your connection to your culture? These are complicated questions, and the answers can be different for every native person and tribe. But some languages are being revived in some pretty unexpected ways. Come here, tell your story. In the 1990s, Jesse Little Do Bayard, a member of the Machbby tribe of Wampaog Nation, started having dreams. In them, familiar-looking people spoke to her in a language that she didn't understand. Then one day, when driving in Massachusetts, she noticed similarities in the street signs that she was passing. And it hit her. The people in her dream were speaking Wampa Naak, the traditional language of her people. See, there is this prophecy from back when her tribe had first met the pilgrims at Plymouth Plantation. It predicted that the Wampa Naak language would disappear and eventually return and the children of the people who played a role in its loss would help resurrect it. True to the prophecy, Wampa Naak hadn't been spoken since the late 1800s. Bayer took her dreams as a sign. She worked with the Machbby and Aquina tribes to launch a language reclamation project. And while getting her mers in linguistics from MIT, she was advised by an expert in indigenous languages who just so happened to be a direct descendant of the white founder of Rhode Island, much like the prophecy foretold. To bring the language back to life, she cross-referenced a Bible that John Elliot, Asco guy, had translated into a language similar to Wampa, plus the dozens of other archival documents from languages in the same family. From those scraps, Barrett constructed a 10,000word Wampa dictionary, began teaching Wampa classes, and even raised her daughter to speak the language, making her the first native speaker in seven generations. And that is the story of Jesse Little Dough Beard. As diverse as native identity can be, varying from person to person and tribe to tribe, what's shared is a common experience of splintered connections to places, practices, languages, and more. In fact, colonization changed how lots of Native people determined what's known as tribal membership. Like, I'm an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation. But not all Native Americans are enrolled tribal members. Before colonization, tribes often used descent to figure out membership. If you were descended from someone in the tribe or were adopted or married in, you were welcomed. We kept it chill. But thanks to standards imposed by the US government over the years, things have shifted for many tribes. Today, each tribe determines their own enrollment criteria. For instance, the Cherokee rely on something called the doll's roles, lists prepared by the US government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to document who was a member of five specific tribes, including the Cherokee. But they weren't perfect. Many people from those tribes didn't sign up out of fear of persecution. Also, the doll's roles limited enrollment to one tribe, even though many native people claimed multiple tribal identities. Regardless, today the only way to become an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation is if at least one of your direct ancestors signed up for that list. Elsewhere, the most widely used way to figure out enrollment eligibility is to require a particular blood quantum or fraction of tribal blood. Quantum blood fractions. Man, this sounds like a sci-fi thriller. But the amount required varies between tribes. For example, someone looking to enroll in the Turtle Mountain Band of TripleA only needs one quarter Indian blood regardless of tribe. But a person seeking to enroll in the Navajo Nation needs to have at least one quarter Navajo blood to be accepted. Thanks, Dad. About 70% of fedally recognized tribes today require a blood quantum, but it's a controversial way of determining tribal enrollment. It's a practice born out of those early dolls rolls days back when the US government was also sorting Native Americans into mixed or fullblood, aka those with European ancestry and those without. The hope in measuring Indianness was that eventually after generations of intermarriage, there wouldn't be many people who qualified as native anymore and the US would not be held to the treaties that they signed. That's one messed up loophole. Many natives today argue that tribes should leave blood quantum in the past, reasoning that it's a colonial invention that treats native identity like a math problem, considering younger generations not native enough. If a child of two enrolled parents doesn't meet Blood Quantum, they miss out on the benefits of tribal citizenship like access to scholarships, religious protections, and healthcare, not to mention a sense of belonging and a cool ID card. And as fewer people qualify as members, what will that mean for the tribe's continued existence? But on the other side, some native people think blood quantum requirements are their best shot at proving a lineage and preserving already close-knit communities. So, it's up to each tribe as a sovereign nation to decide how they want to handle membership. And some tribes are taking action, returning to enrollment based on descendency. In other words, if your parent is in the tribe, you can be in it, too. Like the St. Croy TripleA tribe which voted in 2023 to eliminate blood quantum requirements. And in case you were wondering, can a DNA test prove tribal membership? No. At most, a DNA test might show someone is related to a tribal member, but there's no tribe specific genetic marker that says, ""Congratulations, you're Navajo."" And although there are some DNA markers more likely to be found in people with native ancestry, not all Native Americans have them. So, next time your white neighbor tells you they're Mohawk because 23 and me said so, kindly direct them to this video. So, Native American identity can involve being an enrolled tribal member, but not always. Also, to make things even more nuanced, not all tribes are fedally recognized. The US government chooses which tribes get federal benefits. Currently, 574 of them, though there are some occasional updates. Most benefits and many laws relating to American Indian identity only apply to members of those federally recognized tribes. Additionally, the government issues certificates of degree of Indian or Alaskan Native American blood or CDIB cards. So many cards which entitle holders to those benefits like access to Indian health services. All this has a huge impact on the cultural identity of a tribe and its people. If a tribe isn't fedally recognized, some people don't see it as legitimate. Even if that tribe has been around since time immemorial and without recognition, tribes like the Winnamon Wintu face an even steeper climb in preserving their cultural traditions because they lack legal protections for their religious practices or the clout to stop development on their sacred sites. As for how the federal government decides who gets recognition, that's complicated and we'll get there in a later episode. When it comes to culture, native identity might involve speaking traditional languages and dressing in traditional clothing, or it might not. When it comes to legal status, identity might mean being an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or an unrecognized one, or not an enrolled member at all. Really, it's not a one-sizefits-all kind of deal. But if there's one word I could use to describe native identity, it's this: perseverance. Ever since the first colonizers set foot on the shores of North America, they've worked to dilute, restrain, and destroy native culture. From creating categories to define us to separating us from our beliefs, lands, and languages. But through it all, natives have persevered. And in that perseverance, we begun to reclaim what's been taken from us. In our next episode, we'll look at some of the many ways Native Americans are connected to the land and to each other. and I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-05-27,2025,755,12.583333333333334,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InZacsO8ico,"[Music] For decades, the former name of the Washington football team was a source of anger and frustration for many Native Americans. Vernon Belcor, a leader of the American Indian Movement, put it this way. We welcome all you good Washington football fans, but we don't welcome the chicken feathers, the paint, the cheap Hollywood chance. Leave our culture, leave our spiritual traditions alone. But what was the big deal? Didn't the team name honor Native Americans? Or is that just a myth? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American [Music] History. For a long time, this is how Native Americans were commonly represented. If they weren't out hunting buffalo, they were gathered around a table with some pilgrims eating turkey, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce. As somebody who's worked a lot of retail in my life, my Thanksgiving meal is usually what's ever left in the breakroom fridge. This version of nativeness is about as nuanced as a brick wall. And it comes from a variety of myths and misconceptions that have spread like wildfire from the colonial era to the modern day with real concrete consequences. Take the first Thanksgiving for instance. Countless school plays and classroom crafts has presented it as truth. But the real story of that meal is a lot more sinister. But before we get into that, let me take care of something real quick. Katie, smashbox, please. Myths like the first Thanksgiving are so widespread, fighting them takes serious work. And that can take lots of different forms, including my personal favorite, myth blasting baseball. [Music] Now then, where were we? Oh, yeah, the first Thanksgiving. So, what actually happened that day? In 1620, the pilgrims landed in an untamed wilderness. Except, wait, this place wasn't untamed at all. It already had a name, Puxit, which was also the name of the band of the Wampenog Confederation, who had been farming and living there for generations. But it was a terrible time for the Wampenon. An epidemic from a disease brought over by other Europeans had wiped out up to 90% of their population, leaving them weak and vulnerable. Meanwhile, the English considered all of this God's will and a great time to take some land. When the pilgrims arrived in winter, they robbed the homes and graves of Wampenog, who died, promising to repay what they' taken. They didn't. All the while, the Wampenog leader, Usami, was weighing out his options as tensions with other tribes were brewing. He strategically decided the pilgrims might be good allies if a war broke out. The Wampaogs helped the pilgrims make it through the winter, and the pilgrims did throw a harvest feast, but they didn't invite their neighbors. The Wampenogs heard guns going off and sent 90 men over to help. Only then were the pilgrims like, ""Oh, you want some food?"" And there wasn't enough to eat. So, the Wampenogs went out to hunt some deer. And if there was friendship that day, it didn't last. Within a generation, the tension between Native Americans and English settlers erupted into King Phillip's War, one of the deadliest conflicts in US history. So, while the Thanksgiving myth might seem like no big deal, it hides a grim reality that this strategic temporary alliance kicked off a centuriesl long disaster for the Wampaogs, who, by the way, are still here living in New England. But where did this myth come from and why? Historians point to a few different moments like the mid 1700s when New Englanders sought to establish themselves as the fathers of America or the mid 1800s when the US was pushing further west into Indian territory and Abraham Lincoln was trying to unify the country and the reconstruction period when whites tried to distance the nation's history from enslavement. Essentially, the story was passed on for political reasons, not historically accurate ones. According to historian David Silverman, the false narrative of Thanksgiving creates an emotional burden for Native Americans and promotes a light-hearted view of historical trauma. It contributes the spread of false ideas like natives and colonizers got along and Native Americans are a part of the past. The myth that Native Americans no longer exist, often called the myth of the vanishing Indian, couldn't be further from the truth. I mean, I'm here, aren't I? In fact, I'm one of about 6 million natives living in the US today. Part of the reason why we seem invisible is because the media has done a pretty poor job of showing who we really are. For instance, I remember as a kid feeling like there was just no room for people like me in movies. Many of the most popular films were westerns, which for a long time were the only ways Native Americans were represented to the wider world. These movies made natives seem synonymous with the Wild West, not the here and now. something we also covered in Crash Course Art History. And this omission of native people from the present can have some serious consequences. One survey of more than 6,000 native folks found that 87% of those surveyed believed the average American didn't care about native peoples. That invisibility can cause mental health issues and minimize the effects of anti-native racism. Not to mention the stereotypes that still hang around today in Thanksgiving plays, Halloween costumes, and sports. Like, have you ever seen the Kansas City Chiefs or the Atlanta Brave fans doing this? Yeah. That's called the tomahawk chop, and it's meant to remind us of the savage Indian Warriors wielding their tomahawks at cowboys, just like in those western films. The tomahawk chop is part of this culture we have in the US of using native people as mascots for sports teams. The myth goes like this. Using a Native American as a mascot honors them and the nation's history and traditions. But just like the Thanksgiving myth, that's far from the truth. You know what we need to [Music] do? Like I said earlier, Native Americans aren't just figures from the past, but mascots like these make us seem like we are. In fact, many of the team names that honor Native Americans came about during a time when the US government was trying to assimilate natives out of existence through forcing them onto reservations and into boarding schools. White America was like, ""Boom, colonization done. Here's a mascot to remember the good times."" Native mascots don't bring the average non-native person any closer to actually understanding native people. And disrespect aside, there are real negative effects to that. Studies have shown that exposure to native stereotypes decreases young native people's sense of their own worth and the worth of their communities and can increase depression. And sometimes sports teams use really offensive language that further harms native people, like the Washington football team's old name. Native leaders protested the name for decades. But little changed. When controversy bubbled up in 2014, a Washington football alumni site made this statement. We believe the name deserves to stay. It epitomizes the noble qualities we admire about Native Americans. The same intangibles we expect from Washington's grid iron heroes on game day. Honor, loyalty, unity, respect, courage, and more. And listen, I get it. I'm a huge football fan. But when it comes to the Rword, I can't help but think about how it's been used in the past. Back in the mid 1800s, the Minnesota state government offered $200 per native killed and used the Rword to describe well what they wanted to exchange. So, there's a lot of controversy about this word. Some natives saw no problem with it, while others were offended by it. My take is this. If you wouldn't say it to an actual native person, you probably shouldn't be saying it at all. Susan Shona Harjo, a Cheyenne and Hodogi Muscogi activist who spent decades advocating for the name change has said, ""When I was a girl, you barely could make it through your young life without getting attacked by a bunch of white people."" And they would always go to that word. To many natives, there's a fundamental mismatch between the idea of Indian and the actual lived experience of being one. And this applies to the financial lives of native people, too. Like lots of non-natives think that we are either rich casino Indians or that we're poor and lazy and get everything handed to us. I'll take ironic contradictions for 400. Let's be real. Not all tribes own casinos. For those that do, under a federal law called the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes can only use casino profits for certain things like health care, public safety, education, and infrastructure projects and per capita payments to tribal members. And the vast majority of casinos don't actually produce much revenue for tribes. The whole rich casino Indian thing is a stereotype that grew out of '90s TV and popular shows like South Park and The Sopranos and a growing fear of natives becoming an economic threat. Because the thing is to be really Indian, you need to rely on government handouts, right? You know the drill. As of 2023, natives have the highest poverty rate of any racial group in the US. But media critic Celeste Lroy has pointed out that the casino Indian myth in particular presents natives as immoral, scheming, and undeserving of power and wealth. If people think that you're part of a get-richqu scheme, they're not very likely to help you. So, let's rapidfire myth bust real quick. Checks from the government. Some natives do get them, but it's a payment that they're owed for the use of natural resources on their land. Taxes. Tribes don't pay federal taxes because the US Constitution recognizes them as sovereign nations, but virtually all individual natives pay federal income taxes. College tuition. Most Native students pay for college through loans, needs-based grants, and merit-based scholarships. Same as everybody else. Only sometimes they can get access to native specific scholarships. and state-based tuition waivers if they meet certain criteria. And those tuition waivers are slowly increasing the number of Native Americans who can go to college and graduate. Besides Indian Health Services or IHS, a federal agency that delivers healthcare to nearly 2.6 million American Indians, if a native is receiving government assistance, it's not because they're native. It's because they qualify for the same support open to any US citizen. IHS itself is a result of treaty agreements and federal trust obligations to native people where the government was like, ""We'll take your land and then we'll take care of you."" Sort of. Cuz turns out IHS is chronically underfunded. On average, IHS users get less than half of the money that users of other types of federal healthcare receive each year. So natives aren't even getting everything that they were promised. So what do we do with all of this? We know that these myths ignore the violent traumatic history of colonization and promote stereotypes about native people. All of which harms them and their communities and limits a broader understanding of native people by non-natives. But sometimes things do change. During the racial reckonings of 2020, the threat of major sponsors pulling out ultimately made the Washington football team's owner change his tune and the team was renamed to the Washington Commanders in 2022. But it was the advocacy by indigenous folks like Susan Shon Harjo and Chief Billy Redwing Tayak that brought the issue forward in the first place and continued to fight for decades. There's time and space to start swapping out these myths for real stories of real natives to ditch the native stereotypes in whatever way you know how. Next time we'll learn about Native American identity and just how complicated it can be. I will see you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-05-22,2025,568,9.466666666666669,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPFP9SZnoRs,"You can feel it. They're into you. You're into them. And you are ready to swan dive into the deep, passionate waters of doing it. But wait, how do you know you both want to have sex? Like, for sure, consent seems straightforward. You both want to do it or you don't. But sometimes there's more going on behind a simple yes or no. So, let's unpack consent together. Hi, I'm Shamboo and this is Crash Course Sex. [Music] Heads up, in today's episode, we'll be talking about sexual assault. So, please keep that in mind and take care when watching. The legal definition of consent varies by state. So, when we talk about consent in this episode, we're talking about an agreement between people to engage in mutually enjoyable sexual activity together. And it wasn't that long ago that consent was taught as no means no. But that's not all there is to it. Because saying nothing isn't the same as saying yes. Silence can also mean uncertainty or discomfort, much like in the rest of life. To use a non-sexy example, if my neighbor's kid shows up at my house selling celebrity garden gnomes, I might not respond at first, not because I want a Snoop Dog garden gnome, but because I'm baffled that this is even a thing. Either way, that kid should not shove a garden gnome into my hands. The same is true for sex. Just because someone doesn't say no doesn't always mean they're saying yes. So some college students decided to change things up. After a number of sexual assaults at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, a feminist student group was fed up. So in 1990, they pitched a different way of thinking about consent. Not as no means no, but as yes means yes. In other words, the absence of a no is not the same thing as a yes. Kissing, grinding, or even, well, we've had sex before is not an automatic yes. And if someone is sleeping or unconscious, they cannot say yes. Also, consent to one kind of touch isn't consent to another. Each new action needs its own yes. Antioch College formally adopted the students ideas and created the first ever affirmative consent policy. But when the news hit the wider culture, this idea was framed as ludicrous by media outlets from Saturday Night Live to the New York Times. Many people could not imagine asking, ""Can I kiss you?"" as anything but a buzzkill. But over time, affirmative consent went mainstream. Many colleges, companies, and governments saw the need for yesbased policies, and a handful of US states began using the affirmative definition of consent in their laws. Recently, movements like me too have made it clear how important this definition is. And these days, consent is widely taught as yes means yes. I see you student activists. Affirmative consent clears up a lot of confusion whether someone is with a new partner, in a long-term relationship, or anything in between. Because even if you've been with someone forever, that doesn't mean you have to want sex whenever your partner does. Maybe you want to cool it on collecting celebrity guard gnomes for a bit. And also, affirmative consent clarifies that just because someone wants sex doesn't mean they're saying yes to actually having sex. It's possible to be sexually aroused but not actually consent to doing it right here, right now for any number of reasons. But there are a couple of other huge reasons affirmative consent is so powerful. And they have to do with sexual assault. Often someone experiencing assault can't say no because of something called freeze mode. An involuntary physical response when a person can't move or speak. Freeze is fight orflight's lesserk known cousin. Another way the nervous system responds to a threat. And it's a major reason why the absence of a no has never been a reliable sign of consent. And then there's the fact that someone's body can have an involuntary physiological reaction during non-consensual sex, such as erection or orgasm, which doesn't imply they're okay with what's happening. Physical response does not equal consent. All of this is why when I teach about consent, I encourage people to look for an enthusiastic yes. The only way to be absolutely sure your partner is on board with what's happening is to ask. Try a clarifying question or two, like, ""How are you feeling?"" or ""Do you want to slow things down?"" And here's the thing, context is also super important. It's not just about the yes, but about all the circumstances around it. A yes is only consensual if it's freely given. No pressure or manipulation attached. But here's where things can get complicated. Cultural norms and expectations can make someone feel like they have to say yes, even if they don't want to. Let's test off a sexual script we talked about back in episode 6. It's a set of expectations that cast people in certain roles based on their gender. And it goes a little something like this. Men are confident and take control. They want and initiate sex. It's a woman's job to be sexy, but not too sexual and to accept sex or turn it down. But according to this script, they're also supposed to be nice and accommodating and not hurt anyone's feelings. We might not all comfortably fit into these gender roles, but culture is strong. And research shows that much like glitter, that stuff sticks. While the numbers vary, some surveys have found that more than 20% of sexually active college women have had at least one sexual experience they didn't want, including times when they said yes to please their partner or because their partner pressured them. And in another study, college men reported having unwanted sex, too, when they said yes to sex because they thought they were supposed to. that they'd be mocked if as a guy they turned out a chance to sleep with someone. These scripts can lead to a yes that isn't really a yes. Nobody wants to get pressured into buying a Post Malone garden no. On top of gender norms, consent can also get messy when there's a power imbalance in a relationship. Imagine a student who says yes to sex with a professor because they worry a no could put their grades at risk. Or a person in an unhealthy relationship who says yes because they fear the consequences of making their partner mad if they say no. These yeses are not freely given, so they're not truly consensual. Or imagine someone who's had a few drinks. One is someone too intoxicated to say yes and mean it. In the moment, it's not always clear. If you start drinking, it can be hard to tell when you're too drunk to make good choices. Like in one 2023 study, researchers interviewed multiple pairs of tailgators where each person had an average of four to five drinks. Most tailgators said if the opportunity arose, they themselves were not too intoxicated to consent to sex. But if their tipsy friend wanted to have sex right now, women were more likely to be like, ""Girl, no."" Even though they'd had about the same amount to drink. This isn't to say that consent can only happen when you're 100% sober. But when alcohol is in the mix, it's especially important to check in with your partner, asking things like, ""What do you want to do now? Do you need a break?"" And, ""Are you sure you want to purchase 75 Selena Gomez garden gnomes?"" And don't forget, check in with yourself, too. Do I like this? Do I still want this? If the answer isn't yes, it's time to stop. Now, to be clear, real enthusiastic consent isn't some mythical thing like a working ice cream machine at McDonald's. It happens all the time, every day. But saying yes to sex or any kind of physical intimacy is a decision that can get muddied by culture, power, and alcohol. So, it's worth paying attention not just to what someone says, but to the whole picture. Are they being pressured into saying yes? Did they say yes to touching here or just there? And no matter how far you've gone, a yes can always turn into a no. I promise. The purpose of all of this is not to make consent feel like a bunch of hoops you got to jump through. It's to make sure sex is a good time for everyone. That it's fun, pleasurable, joyful. Consent isn't just a safeguard against a bad time. It's the gateway to a really great time. And research backs this up. Studies show a close link between sexual satisfaction and consent, which makes sense because behind an enthusiastic yes, there are all kinds of good feelings going on. Like, I feel comfortable with you. I like this. I want this. I'm buying this Samuel L. Jackson gnome, and I have the perfect place to put it. What is it with you and the garden gnomes? Teen Chan, don't knock it till you have a garden to put it in. Okay. Also, phrases like, ""Can I do this to you?"" or I want you to do that to me. These are ways of confidently owning what you want. And no matter what sexual scripts tell you, it's totally okay to express what you want and that you want it or that you're not into something. In that case, you can say things like, ""I don't want to have sex, but I do want to make out or I like you, but this isn't what I want right now."" Or simply, ""Let's stop. This doesn't feel right."" Consent is a lifelong practice, not something you learn once in sex and forget about and not something you only talk about at the start of a relationship. It's something we should always be practicing. And it's a path to better sex. More joy, more pleasure, and more trust and respect for your partner and yourself, which is pretty hot if you ask me. Next time we're talking all about porn. See you there. This episode of Crash Course Sexed was produced in partnership with the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.

[Music]",what is consent?  sex ed  11,"you can feel it. they're into you. you're into them. and you are ready to swan dive into the deep, passionate waters of doing it. but wait, how do you know you both want to have sex? like, for sure, consent seems straightforward. you both want to do it or you don't. but sometimes there's more going on behind a simple yes or no. so, let's unpack consent together. hi, i'm shamboo and this is crash course sex.  music  heads up, in today's episode, we'll be talking about sexual assault. so, please keep that in mind and take care when watching. the legal definition of consent varies by state. so, when we talk about consent in this episode, we're talking about an agreement between people to engage in mutually enjoyable sexual activity together. and it wasn't that long ago that consent was taught as no means no. but that's not all there is to it. because saying nothing isn't the same as saying yes. silence can also mean uncertainty or discomfort, much like in the rest of life. to use a non-sexy example, if my neighbor's kid shows up at my house selling celebrity garden gnomes, i might not respond at first, not because i want a snoop dog garden gnome, but because i'm baffled that this is even a thing. either way, that kid should not shove a garden gnome into my hands. the same is true for sex. just because someone doesn't say no doesn't always mean they're saying yes. so some college students decided to change things up. after a number of sexual assaults at antioch college in yellow springs, ohio, a feminist student group was fed up. so in 1990, they pitched a different way of thinking about consent. not as no means no, but as yes means yes. in other words, the absence of a no is not the same thing as a yes. kissing, grinding, or even, well, we've had sex before is not an automatic yes. and if someone is sleeping or unconscious, they cannot say yes. also, consent to one kind of touch isn't consent to another. each new action needs its own yes. antioch college formally adopted the students ideas and created the first ever affirmative consent policy. but when the news hit the wider culture, this idea was framed as ludicrous by media outlets from saturday night live to the new york times. many people could not imagine asking, ""can i kiss you?"" as anything but a buzzkill. but over time, affirmative consent went mainstream. many colleges, companies, and governments saw the need for yesbased policies, and a handful of us states began using the affirmative definition of consent in their laws. recently, movements like me too have made it clear how important this definition is. and these days, consent is widely taught as yes means yes. i see you student activists. affirmative consent clears up a lot of confusion whether someone is with a new partner, in a long-term relationship, or anything in between. because even if you've been with someone forever, that doesn't mean you have to want sex whenever your partner does. maybe you want to cool it on collecting celebrity guard gnomes for a bit. and also, affirmative consent clarifies that just because someone wants sex doesn't mean they're saying yes to actually having sex. it's possible to be sexually aroused but not actually consent to doing it right here, right now for any number of reasons. but there are a couple of other huge reasons affirmative consent is so powerful. and they have to do with sexual assault. often someone experiencing assault can't say no because of something called freeze mode. an involuntary physical response when a person can't move or speak. freeze is fight orflight's lesserk known cousin. another way the nervous system responds to a threat. and it's a major reason why the absence of a no has never been a reliable sign of consent. and then there's the fact that someone's body can have an involuntary physiological reaction during non-consensual sex, such as erection or orgasm, which doesn't imply they're okay with what's happening. physical response does not equal consent. all of this is why when i teach about consent, i encourage people to look for an enthusiastic yes. the only way to be absolutely sure your partner is on board with what's happening is to ask. try a clarifying question or two, like, ""how are you feeling?"" or ""do you want to slow things down?"" and here's the thing, context is also super important. it's not just about the yes, but about all the circumstances around it. a yes is only consensual if it's freely given. no pressure or manipulation attached. but

It took billions of years of life on Earth before the fish-like organisms from which we evolved developed lungs and a movable tongue, which would prove to be kind of important for human speech. So, we learned to speak and share our ideas. And then, I'm skipping over here a lot. Don't at me, Hank. We learned to write. Writing let us put ideas down and exchange thoughts with people who weren't in our immediate vicinity. But for a long time access to the written word and by extension access to ideas was very limited. Paper was expensive. There were political interests served by limiting who could read and write. And then came the printing press which dramatically increased not only access to knowledge but also knowledge production. Then there were newspapers and pamphlets. Then broadcasting the radio, the TV and then well let's see what's inside my friend the secret compartment. Oh would you look at that? It's a floppy disc. Only we didn't have any floppy discs, so we got these floppy disc coasters. Anyway, then there was the internet, which I probably don't need to tell you changed everything about how we communicate for better and for worse. But at its very best, the explosion of information now available on the internet can be used to make knowledge more accessible. It can make different perspectives more accessible. It can remind us that how things are now is not how they always were or how they will always be. And that's what we're trying to do here at Crash Course. Like in the last year, we released a series on religions, exploring how a variety of religions respond to life's greatest mysteries. We also made political theory, a series that zooms way out, considering how questions first raised millennia ago, can provide new lenses for understanding our world now. Then there's sex ed, which trades shame for science, sociology, and stories, helping learners build deeper knowledge about their bodies, their health, and themselves. And we're launching an in-depth series on Native American history, which begins well before 1492 and extends into the present. So, yeah, we've been tackling a lot at Crash Course recently, and no matter the series, we're committed to a couple things. It's going to be free and it's going to be highquality, meaning accurate and fact-checked, but also engaging and fun because we're trying to make the best version of information post floppy disc on the internet. And that means welcoming as many people in as we can. It's an ambitious goal and if I'm being honest, an expensive one. Each video is worked on by over 20 people who are absolutely devoted to quality. From subject matter experts to writers, editors, producers, animators, hosts, the list goes on and on. Ultimately, the goal of Crash Course is attainable because of one very important reason, and that's you. Each year, we produce a new Crash Course coin, and each coin that people like you purchase helps us reach thousands of learners. And together, our reach continues to grow. Like recent research from the American Historical Association shows Crash Course is used in classrooms in every state, even more so than a number of federally funded educational resources. This year, the coin design is inspired by access to information, represented in historical flash points from the printing press to the advent of the internet. The design represents our mission to provide free access to good information that's easy and fun to learn. And that's a mission you join when you purchase a Crash Course Coin. These beautiful objects are minted in Arkansas from hand engraved dyes at Shire Post Mint. And for $100, you can help us reach 2,000 learners and receive a beautiful nickel coin. For $500, you can help us reach 10,000 learners with a brass one. And for those able to give $1,000, you can help us reach 20,000 learners and receive a colored titanium coin, which includes a unique handstamped number and a signed thank you card from me and my brother Hank. The thank you card, by the way, is made at Noteworthy Printing in Missoula on an antique letter press, not unlike the ones used to print the first books in the 15th century. For the first time this year, we're offering a limited edition premium silver coin for $5,000. In addition to helping us reach a 100,000 learners, you'll adopt a week of Crash Course, meaning you'll get a report made just for you about who has been watching Crash Course and all of the learning that you made possible. This is our fifth year of the Crash Course Coin, and we know some folks are collectors. So, this year we've added a collector's plaque where you can display your coins, whether you're just starting your collection or you've been getting all the available coins every year. We are really honored to do this work. I think of Crash Course as one of the most meaningful projects I've ever been a part of.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-05-15,2025,534,8.9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDixrkU1pp4,"Abortion is a charged topic, with strong opinions all around. And it also involves complex personal decisions. But knowing what abortion is is a key part of any comprehensive sex ed course. We won’t get too deep into the politics or legal situation surrounding abortion today, because those factors are ever-changing. But we will shine a light on what’s true about abortions, and who gets them. Hi! I’m Shan Boodram and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] Head’s up: in today’s episode, we’ll be talking about sensitive topics, including miscarriages, and why people get abortions. So please keep that in mind and take care when watching. When people talk about abortion, they’re usually referring to the medical process that ends a pregnancy. That’s called an induced abortion, and that’s our focus today. But there’s also spontaneous abortions. That’s the medical term for a miscarriage, when someone’s body terminates a pregnancy on its own before the 20th week. A spontaneous abortion might require some of the same medical care used in induced abortions, but it depends on the specific case. A healthcare provider can share more information if you need it, and you can learn more about why miscarriages happen in Episode 9. We’ll be referring to cisgender women a lot in this episode, since that’s who most of the research and discussion focuses on, but trans folk may also need pregnancy and reproductive health care services, including abortions. Now when it comes to induced abortions, there are two main ways they can happen. The first is by taking medication: two kinds of pills over two days, that are prescribed by a doctor or another licensed healthcare provider. The first pill stops a pregnancy from developing further, and the second pill empties the uterus. A medical abortion can happen entirely at home or partially at a doctor’s office, and it can happen up to 10 or 11 weeks after the first day of someone’s last period. The second kind is an in-clinic abortion, when a doctor uses light suction to empty the uterus. While the clinic visit may take longer, the procedure itself usually lasts 10 minutes or less, and can happen up to 14 to 16 weeks after someone’s last period. There’s also another version of in-clinic abortion that can happen up to 24 weeks after someone’s last period, which can be a little more involved and take a bit longer. These kinds of abortions are significantly less common, though. In 2021, about ninety-three percent of abortions in the U.S. happened in the first thirteen weeks of pregnancy, according to the CDC. And less than one percent happened after twenty-one weeks. As far as safety goes, surveys have found that when abortions are done under the care of a trained medical provider, they rarely have complications. A 2015 study that looked at data from more than 50,000 patients reported that complications happen in about two percent of cases. Like we’ll say many times during this episode, though, every pregnancy and every person is unique. And if you’d like to learn more about any of these procedures, you can find more information in the description. Teen Shan: So, who gets abortions? And why? Good questions! The short answer is… well, there is no short answer. The Guttmacher Institute, which has been tracking this kind of data since the late 1960s, estimates that just under a quarter of women in the U.S. will have an abortion before they’re 45. This number is lower than it was in the past, and researchers point to a variety of reasons for that, like better contraception use and fewer teenagers having sex. But that estimate of just under a quarter of U.S. women represents millions of people. And when you ask that big of a group of people why they might do anything, you’re gonna get a huge variety of answers. One of the most widely-referenced studies that’s been done about abortion is called the Turnaway Study. It started collecting data in 2008, and surveyed hundreds of women about their experiences with abortion, over multiple years. As part of that study, about 950 women shared why they were seeking abortions. And forty percent of them said it was at least partly for financial reasons — either in general, or because of specific reasons like unemployment. Meanwhile, about twenty percent of study participants said they were seeking an abortion because having a child would interfere with their school, work, or other life opportunities. And just under thirty percent said it was because they had to focus on their other children. And when it comes to that last point, about already having kids — a 2021 review by the CDC looked at data from over half a million abortions, and found that sixty percent of those patients were already parents. Someone might also have multiple reasons for getting an abortion. And some of them might have nothing to do with finances, family, or their living situation. Notably, some people — including about 110 women from that Turnaway Study — sought abortions for medical reasons. They might have a health condition that makes pregnancy dangerous for them, or problems might come up during the pregnancy that affect them, the fetus, or both. So, there are a lot of variables here — and there can be a lot of emotions. These are often complicated, heavy decisions. And while the data shows that most abortions are to end unintended pregnancies, that isn’t always the case. One 2015 study reported that about four percent of abortions in the U.S. end a pregnancy that was intentional but had medical complications. Teen Shan: I see what you mean about the whole “there’s no short answer” thing. Mhmm, exactly. When it comes to mental health, surveys have found that getting an abortion affects different people in different ways. (You might notice a trend happening here.) And this is also something that researchers from the Turnaway Study have looked into. As a part of that larger project, they recruited more than 600 women who’d received abortions. And with their permission, they called them twice a year for five years, to ask what emotions they were feeling about their decision. Overall, the team found that no matter how the women felt at first, nearly everyone’s emotions — both positive and negative — were less intense after two years. And after half a decade, at least ninety-seven percent of women reported that getting an abortion was the right decision for them, even if they also said it had been a hard decision to make at the time. As a reminder, though, while data can shed some light on how a group of people can feel, and can be great for understanding the big picture, it also can’t tell you how everyone will feel. Like, in the Turnaway Study, about half of the women said that deciding to have an abortion was very or somewhat difficult — and the other half reported that it wasn’t a hard decision. Like we’ve said, every pregnancy, and every person, is unique. Now, when it comes to abortion access — at the time we’re filming this, in October 2024, the legal situation in the U.S. is complicated. With a case called Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled in the 1970s that the Constitution protected a person’s right to an abortion. But that ruling was overturned in 2022, and now, abortion access is largely up to individual states. And even when laws aren’t in limbo, it’s also something activists — and your local politicians, and your neighbors, and your third cousin on Instagram — are often vocal about. With all these beliefs swirling around, you might’ve heard that there's two camps when it comes to abortion: those who argue that abortion should be banned, and those who argue that legal abortion should be available. But if you dig into the research, what people actually think about abortion is much more complex, because it sits right at the crossroads of law, philosophy, religion, and science. Kind of like how cats find a way to sit right in the middle of whatever you’re doing. Since 1995, the Pew Research Center has kept track of data on what Americans think about abortion. And while those numbers have varied a bit over the years, the number of Americans who think abortion should be legal in all or most cases is usually above fifty percent. As of 2024, it was sixty-three percent. Teen Shan: Wait, what does “all or some cases” mean? Way to think critically about data, Teen Shan! So in 2022, the folks at Pew dug a little deeper into this, and found there’s a lot going on under that “all or most cases” umbrella. Things like how long a woman has been pregnant, whether the pregnancy threatens her health, and the circumstances of how she got pregnant — like, whether or not the sex was consensual or not — affected a lot of people’s answers. Overall, only about nineteen percent of participants supported the idea that abortion should be legal in all cases, and eight percent said it should be illegal in all cases. But a whopping seventy-one percent answered with some version of “it depends.” Here’s where that leaves us today. Abortion will continue to be debated, and attitudes and laws will keep evolving, too. We hope this data about what happens and why helps you understand this big, complex topic a little better. Next time, we’re talking about consent. See you then.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-05-13,2025,682,11.366666666666667,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgzR-RSfc9U,"This is the story of a nation that, according to the United States, doesn’t exist. Let me explain. The members of the Chinook Indian Nation were skilled fishers, using nets called seines to rein in salmon they would often use for trade. They honored the first salmon run of the year with rituals, where they cooked and ate the fish before returning their bones to the Columbia River in what’s now Oregon and Washington state. In fact, the Chinook still practice the First Salmon Ceremony. Their culture is alive and well. But to the U.S. federal government? There is no Chinook Indian Nation. Hi, I’m Che Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [THEME MUSIC] Five hundred seventy-four. That’s how many federally recognized Native nations exist today in what’s now known as the United States. And knowing that can feel a bit…disorienting. I mean, that’s more than ten times the number of U.S. states. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just call them tribes, instead of “nations”? It’s not wrong to say tribe, and many Native folks use the two words interchangeably. But there’s a good reason to use nation in this episode. We say “nations” when talking about the relationship between tribal governments and the United States because of what they have in common, and that’s sovereignty — an inherent, pre-existing right to govern themselves and their territory. Meaning, essentially, to make and enforce their own laws. Sovereignty is the basis of a government-to-government relationship, like the one between the U.S. and Mexico. It’s how treaties get interpreted, Supreme Court cases get decided, laws get legislated, and policies get…policied? And you really can’t understand Native history — or the present, for that matter — without first understanding what sovereignty means in action. Native nations like the Chinook were running themselves long before the United States existed. In fact, the Chinook fed and sheltered Lewis and Clark when they came a-surveying the land that was not theirs. So sovereignty isn’t something the U.S. ever gave these nations. The U.S. recognizes tribal sovereignty, which didn’t just end with colonization. It’s right there in the Constitution, in a totally chill bit called the Indian Commerce Clause: [COLONIAL CARL] “The Congress shall have power …to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian Tribes.” [record scratch] [CHE] Did you catch it? It’s…subtle. But by saying Congress can regulate trade with other sovereign governments, it’s acknowledging that Native nations are among those governments. And they’ll be treated that way. Not as special-interest groups. Not as random individuals. But as equally sovereign nations. And if that wasn’t enough, — spoiler: it definitely wasn’t enough — the government formally recognized Native sovereignty again in the early 1800s, with the Marshall Trilogy. Which sounds like a sci-fi franchise, but it’s actually a series of Supreme Court cases that say the federal government, not the states, makes the policies about Native nations. I'm lookin’ at you Georgia - don't make me come down there. The grand finale of the Marshall trilogy, Worcester v. Georgia in 1832, brought us this classic: [COLONIAL CARL] “Tribes are distinct, independent, political communities, retaining their original natural rights, as the undisputed possessors of the soil, from time immemorial.” [CHE] Got a real ring to it. But the same case that recognized Native sovereignty also reined it in, by classifying tribes as “domestic dependent nations.” “Domestic” meaning they’re within the borders of the U.S., “dependent” because the federal government has both responsibility toward them and power over them, and “nations” because that inherent right to govern themselves never actually went away. And if you’re thinking, “Wow, that sounds like a completely unique, complicated, and contradictory pretzel of a situation?” Yes, hello, welcome. It is. The whole “domestic dependent nations” thing made Native sovereignty look more like… “quasi-sovereignty”. Congress now had plenary power over Native nations, or the broad ability to limit or enhance tribal authority. They could basically decide if the U.S. government would treat Native tribes as nations or not, on a case-by-case basis. And that had big consequences for the Chinook — who I mentioned earlier – along with many other tribes. Remember, tribal sovereignty is an inherent right. So the Chinook were never not sovereign. But they needed federal recognition in order to actually act as a sovereign nation. But one thing that can help a tribe’s case for federal recognition is if they entered into a treaty with the U.S. — which several Chinook tribes did in 1851. These treaties were overseen by the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs and then shipped off to the Senate and tabled. That Congressional dismissal would be a major factor in the long fight for recognition of the Chinook Indian Nation’s sovereignty. And Congress’s power doesn’t stop there. They can also terminate a nation’s federally recognized status and with it their ability to self-govern. Which happened to the Chinook when they were listed as one of the terminated federal tribes in the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act, which took effect in 1956. We’ll talk much more about termination later in this series. As processes for federal recognition changed over the decades, the Chinook tried and failed to gain theirs back. And between 2001 and 2002, they were even successful, on the basis that one of the treaties had been ratified. But George W. Bush’s administration reversed that decision just after eighteen months. It was a huge loss for the tribe— but not the end of their fight for recognition. So why is tribal sovereignty such a big deal? Well, in the United States today, Native nations, the federal government, and the states are the only three political entities that have sovereignty. Being recognized by the federal government means Native nations can make their own laws and govern their own citizens. And they can set their own rules for who’s considered a citizen. Recognized sovereignty also means Native nations can enforce their own laws and run their own court systems. They can police their own borders and regulate trade within them, which can create jobs and drive economic growth. Native nations can also provide services geared toward the welfare of their citizens, like healthcare and first responders. Like, the federal government funds the Indian Health Service, which provided vaccines during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But members of non-federally recognized Nations, like the Chinook, don’t have full access to the IHS or its resources. So some tribal members had to travel hours to get vaccinated. And importantly, federally recognized nations have authority over how their lands get used. A lot of tribal lands are owned by the federal government and held in trust for the tribe, but tribes themselves have the final word on much of what happens to those lands — and states can’t meddle in the matter. And this includes things like hunting, fishing, and gathering rights. Without federal recognition, the Chinook don’t have clear fishing rights to the salmon that are such a big part of their culture and history. That means they have to pay for fishing licenses just like anyone else, even though they have an ancestral connection to the fish. Recognized sovereignty also means being able to collect taxes from tribal citizens, and non-citizens conducting business on tribal lands. States can’t tax Native nations or tribal members, but in a strange loophole, if a non-Indian buys a coffee at a tribal-owned gas station, the state can collect sales taxes off that purchase. Isn’t the legal system fun? By and large, recognized sovereignty means Native nations can handle their own business, without interference from the states. But Native nations and states sometimes enter into agreements, government-to-government, to work together on certain issues. Like, if a nation wants to open a casino, they have to enter into a compact with the state where that casino will be located. Or if the child of an enrolled tribal member needs to enter foster care, the nation and the state will often share resources. At the end of the day, sovereignty means Native nations are better able to pass on their traditions, maintain their cultural identities, preserve their languages, and determine their own futures. And without federal recognition, all of that becomes a whole lot harder. But even when the federal government acknowledges a tribe’s sovereignty, it can still have a lot of control. State laws may not be enforced in Indian Country. But Congress can give states some power over tribal affairs, in ways that diminish Native sovereignty. And it’s done so before — without consulting Native nations first. For example, in 1953, Congress enacted Public Law 280, which gave state law enforcement control they didn’t previously have on Native lands in six states: Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Before that, Native nations handled minor crimes on reservations, and the federal government dealt with any major crimes. But after PL 280 passed — again, without Native consent — the nations suddenly shared criminal jurisdiction with the state, which limited tribes’ authority to deal with minor crimes. On top of that, Native nations in those states were suddenly disqualified from federal funding to run their own courts. It’s that congressional power to rein in Native governance that makes their sovereignty a bit of a…gray area. Even though federally recognized tribes are sovereign nations… they can’t do a lot of the things we’d associate with nations. Like, the Navajo Nation cannot go to war, sign an international trade treaty, or make its own currency. And the U.S. has a habit of disrespecting the sovereignty that Native nations do have. Both before and after the Constitution recognized tribal sovereignty, colonists and the U.S. government actively undermined it by killing and displacing Native people, taking Native land, and trying to get rid of Native cultures altogether. As we’ll see throughout this series, that lack of respect for tribal sovereignty had some dire consequences for Native people that we’re still dealing with today. So where does that leave us — and where does it leave the Chinook Indian Nation? Well, in 2017, the Chinook filed a suit against the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs claiming that they deserved to be federally acknowledged. But, as of this filming in 2024, it hasn’t happened…yet. The Chinook Indian Nation is still pursuing every pathway it can to regain their recognition. Regardless of recognition, the right of Native nations to govern themselves has existed since time immemorial. It wasn’t a gift the U.S. gave to these tribes. It’s something that Native nations already had — an inherent right that didn’t cease to exist when their lands were colonized. And today, Native sovereignty is the basis of a government-to-government relationship, a nation-within-a-nation situation that is… to say the least…complicated. We’ll keep exploring it a whole lot more throughout this series. Next time, we’ll talk about some of the scariest myths and misconceptions about Native Americans. And I’ll see you then.

there is no chinook indian nation. hi, i m che jim and welcome to crash course native american history.  theme music  five hundred seventy-four. that s how many federally recognized native nations exist today in what s now known as the united states. and knowing that can feel a bit disorienting. i mean, that s more than ten times the number of u.s. states. wouldn t it make more sense to just call them tribes, instead of  nations ? it s not wrong to say tribe, and many native folks use the two words interchangeably. but there s a good reason to use nation in this episode. we say  nations  when talking about the relationship between tribal governments and the united states because of what they have in common, and that s sovereignty   an inherent, pre-existing right to govern themselves and their territory. meaning, essentially, to make and enforce their own laws. sovereignty is the basis of a government-to-government relationship, like the one between the u.s. and mexico. it s how treaties get interpreted, supreme court cases get decided, laws get legislated, and policies get policied? and you really can t understand native history   or the present, for that matter   without first understanding what sovereignty means in action. native nations like the chinook were running themselves long before the united states existed. in fact, the chinook fed and sheltered lewis and clark when they came a-surveying the land that was not theirs. so sovereignty isn t something the u.s. ever gave these nations. the u.s. recognizes tribal sovereignty, which didn t just end with colonization. it s right there in the constitution, in a totally chill bit called the indian commerce clause   colonial carl   the congress shall have power  to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the indian tribes.   record scratch   che  did you catch it? it s subtle. but by saying congress can regulate trade with other sovereign governments, it s acknowledging that native nations are among those governments. and they ll be treated that way. not as special-interest groups. not as random individuals. but as equally sovereign nations. and if that wasn t enough,   spoiler  it definitely wasn t enough   the government formally recognized native sovereignty again in the early 1800s, with the marshall trilogy. which sounds like a sci-fi franchise, but it s actually a series of supreme court cases that say the federal government, not the states, makes the policies about native nations. i'm lookin  at you georgia - don't make me come down there. the grand finale of the marshall trilogy, worcester v. georgia in 1832, brought us this classic   colonial carl   tribes are distinct, independent, political communities, retaining their original natural rights, as the undisputed possessors of the soil, from time immemorial.   che  got a real ring to it. but the same case that recognized native sovereignty also reined it in, by classifying tribes as  domestic dependent nations.   domestic  meaning they re within the borders of the u.s.,  dependent  because the federal government has both responsibility toward them and power over them, and  nations  because that inherent right to govern themselves never actually went away. and if you re thinking,  wow, that sounds like a completely unique, complicated, and contradictory pretzel of a situation?  yes, hello, welcome. it is. the whole  domestic dependent nations  thing made native sovereignty look more like   quasi-sovereignty . congress now had plenary power over native nations, or the broad ability to limit or enhance tribal authority. they could basically decide if the u.s. government would treat native tribes as nations or not, on a case-by-case basis. and that had big consequences for the chinook   who i mentioned earlier   along with many other tribes. remember, tribal sovereignty is an inherent right. so the chinook were never not sovereign. but they needed federal recognition in order to actually act as a sovereign nation. but one thing that can help a tribe s case for federal recognition is if they entered into a treaty with the u.s.   which several chinook tribes did in 1851. these treaties were overseen by the oregon superintendent of indian affairs and then shipped off to the senate and tabled. that congressional dismissal would be a major factor in the long fight for recognition of the chinook indian nation s sovereignty. and congress s power doesn t stop there. they can also terminate a nation s federally recognized status and with it their ability to self-govern. which happened to the chinook when they were listed as one of the terminated federal tribes in the western oregon indian termination act, which took effect in 1956. we ll talk much more about termination later in this series. as processes for federal recognition changed over the decades, the chinook tried and failed to gain theirs back. and between 2001 and 2002, they were even successful, on the basis that one of the treaties had been ratified. but george w. bush s administration reversed that decision just after eighteen months. it was a huge loss for the tribe  but not the end of their fight for recognition. so why is tribal sovereignty such a big deal? well, in the united states today, native nations, the federal government, and the states are the only three political entities that have sovereignty. being recognized by the federal government means native nations can make their own laws and govern their own citizens. and they can set their own rules for who s considered a citizen. recognized sovereignty also means native nations can enforce their own laws and run their own court systems. they can police their own borders and regulate trade within them, which can create jobs and drive economic growth. native nations can also provide services geared toward the welfare of their citizens, like healthcare and first responders. like, the federal government funds the indian health service, which provided vaccines during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. but members of non-federally recognized nations, like the chinook, don t have full access to the ihs or its resources. so some tribal members had to travel hours to get vaccinated. and importantly, federally recognized nations have authority over how their lands get used. a lot of tribal lands are owned by the federal government and held in trust for the tribe, but tribes themselves have the final word on much of what happens to those lands   and states can t meddle in the matter. and this includes things like hunting, fishing, and gathering rights. without federal recognition, the chinook don t have clear fishing rights to the salmon that are such a big part of their culture and history. that means they have to pay for fishing licenses just like anyone else, even though they have an ancestral connection to the fish. recognized sovereignty also means being able to collect taxes from tribal citizens, and non-citizens conducting business on tribal lands. states can t tax native nations or tribal members, but in a strange loophole, if a non-indian buys a coffee at a tribal-owned gas station, the state can collect sales taxes off that purchase. isn t the legal system fun? by and large, recognized sovereignty means native nations can handle their own business, without interference from the states. but native nations and states sometimes enter into agreements, government-to-government, to work together on certain issues. like, if a nation wants to open a casino, they have to enter into a compact with the state where that casino will be located. or if the child of an enrolled tribal member needs to enter foster care, the nation and the state will often share resources. at the end of the day, sovereignty means native nations are better able to pass on their traditions, maintain their cultural identities, preserve their languages, and determine their own futures. and without federal recognition, all of that becomes a whole lot harder. but even when the federal government acknowledges a tribe s sovereignty, it can still have a lot of control. state laws may not be enforced in indian country. but congress can give states some power over tribal affairs, in ways that diminish native sovereignty. and it s done so before   without consulting native nations first. for example, in 1953, congress enacted public law 280, which gave state law enforcement control they didn t previously have on native lands in six states  alaska, california, minnesota, nebraska, oregon, and wisconsin. before that, native nations handled minor crimes on reservations, and the federal government dealt with any major crimes. but after pl 280 passed   again, without native consent   the nations suddenly shared criminal jurisdiction with the state, which limited tribes  authority to deal with minor crimes. on top of that, native nations in those states were suddenly disqualified from federal funding to run their own courts. it s that congressional power to rein in native governance that makes their sovereignty a bit of a gray area. even though federally recognized tribes are sovereign nations  they can t do a lot of the things we d associate with nations. like, the navajo nation cannot go to war, sign an international trade treaty, or make its own currency. and the u.s. has a habit of disrespecting the sovereignty that native nations do have. both before and after the constitution recognized tribal sovereignty, colonists and the u.s. government actively undermined it by killing and displacing native people, taking native land, and trying to get rid of native cultures altogether. as we ll see throughout this series, that lack of respect for tribal sovereignty had some dire consequences for native people that we re still dealing with today. so where does that leave us   and where does it leave the chinook indian nation? well, in 2017, the chinook filed a suit against the department of the interior and the bureau of indian affairs claiming that they deserved to be federally acknowledged. but, as of this filming in 2024, it hasn t happened yet. the chinook indian nation is still pursuing every pathway it can to regain their recognition. regardless of recognition, the right of native nations to govern themselves has existed since time immemorial. it wasn t a gift the u.s. gave to these tribes. it s something that native nations already had   an inherent right that didn t cease to exist when their lands were colonized. and today, native sovereignty is the basis of a government-to-government relationship, a nation-within-a-nation situation that is  to say the least complicated. we ll keep exploring it a whole lot more throughout this series. next time, we ll talk about some of the scariest myths and misconceptions about native americans. and i ll see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course native american history, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis, indiana and was made with the help of these nice people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone, forever, you can join our community on patreon.",11712,1928

These are just some of the things I had to deal with when I was pregnant. And we're only scratching the surface of the list. And I'm not going to lie though, some of the hair growth was nice. Yes, this is all mine. Most sex focuses on how not to get pregnant. But what if you are or a want to be someday? I can tell you there was so much I never knew about pregnancy and birth until another human being was literally growing inside of my body. Hi, I'm Shamboo, birther of two babies, and this is Crash Course Sex [Music] Ed. All right, let's start with getting pregnant. Once a month during ovulation, an ovary releases an egg, which stays in the fallopian tube for about 12 to 24 hours. And if a sperm doesn't come by through PNV sex or artificial insemination, the egg calls it quits. The uterus sheds the lining. It prepared for a fertilized egg contracts to get all that lining out and boom, period cramps. Now, sperm can survive around 5 days in the fallopian tubes, camping out in case an egg shows up. So, if someone with a uterus has unprotected sex, either on ovulation day or up to 5 days before it, that's when they have the highest chance of getting pregnant. This is called the fertile window, and it varies from body to body. Many people try for months or even years to get pregnant for lots of reasons. Menstrual cycles aren't always easy to track, and age is a big factor. Everyone's fertility decreases as we get older. Sperm health and mobility are also important when it comes to getting pregnant. But let's say that everything goes swimmingly. What next? The egg gets fertilized by the sperm and then makes its way to the uterus. During this journey, there's a risk of the egg getting stuck, causing an ectopic pregnancy, aka any pregnancy that develops outside the uterus. About 2% of pregnancies are ectopic and they require immediate medical attention. Ideally though that fertilized egg travels into the uterus and embeds itself into the nice cozy endometrial tissue. This is called implantation and it might come with cramping and very light bleeding. Sometimes though implantation doesn't happen for any number of reasons. The egg might not be viable because of things like genetic abnormalities or uterine scarring from medical conditions might make it harder for the egg to attach. Research shows about half of all fertilized eggs don't implant. And it's estimated that 10 to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, which is the loss of pregnancy before the 20th week. After week 20, it's referred to as a still birth. Most miscarriages happen because the fetus simply wasn't developing properly. But despite the fact that miscarriages are common and a natural part of the reproductive process, there's still a lot of shame and stigma around pregnancy loss. The truth is, miscarriages can be devastating, so there's no room to add any unnecessary shame to the experience. All right, back to it. If everything keeps moving forward, that fertilized egg will divide in two parts. One becomes an embryo and eventually a fetus, and one becomes a placenta. The placenta is a temporary organ attached to the uterine wall on one side and the fetus on the other. Everything the fetus needs goes from the parents bloodstream through the placenta, down the umbilical cord, and to the fetus. Pregnant people are out here growing a whole life support system. The placenta produces its own specialized hormones, too. HCG thickens the uterine lining and stops menration, while HPL prepares the body for breastfeeding and helps the fetus get nutrients. Those definitely aren't the only hormonal changes, though. Estrogen and progesterone levels also go up, and lots of other specialized hormones start swirling around, and that has an effect on pretty much everything. A typical pregnancy is about 40 weeks divided into three trimesters. And the symptoms start right off the bat. The first trimester is when all the fetus's major body systems and organs are forming. So most pregnant folks feel exhausted. And really everything that happens when someone is pregnant is sort of hijacking their system for the benefit of the fetus. Take morning sickness, which can actually happen at any time of day. Experts think it might be a protective adaptation. If you feel sick, you're going to avoid food and other substances that might be harmful to the fetus. Did knowing that make me feel any better about the 20 straight weeks that I felt like I was in a dinghy and choppy waters? Not so much. Breasts might be painful because hormones are causing them to grow and swell and all the ducts inside are preparing to produce milk for breastfeeding. And a pregnant person's feet might even grow because a hormone called relaxin makes ligaments stretchier to prepare the pelvis to expand during birth. Meanwhile, the labia may also increase in size and the vulva, vagina, and cervix may change color because of increased blood flow. And speaking of blood flow, get this. If you get pregnant, your blood volume significantly increases, sometimes as much as doubling. This can lead to nose bleeds, and this is the reason why a pregnant person's nose might look bigger, too. Maybe Pinocchio wasn't a liar after all. I remember feeling so shocked by a lot of these symptoms. American culture tends to be pretty heavy on the whole motherhood is a gift thing and doesn't leave a lot of room for the messy reality, but knowing what to expect when expecting can make all the difference. And luckily, lots of the worst symptoms subside by the second trimester. If you're pregnant, you'll likely start to feel the fetus move about 16 to 20 weeks in, which can be a magical moment. What's less magical is that your rib cage expands and your uterus grows, pushing aside other organs. That's why it may feel harder to catch your breath in later pregnancy, why you got to pee all the time, and why you can't eat large meals. Everything is just squished. Finally, in the last few weeks of the third trimester, the fetus drops lower into the pelvis, and the process of getting that baby out begins. There are three stages of childirth, and it takes a lot longer than it looks in the movies. The first stage is usually the longest, and it's divided into early labor and active labor. Early labor can take hours or even days. It's when the uterus starts squeezing to push the baby down into the cervix. Those are contractions. The cervix begins to thin and also opens or dilates to around 6 cm and the body starts clearing out some of the protections it built for the fetus. Like the cervix forms a protective covering of mucus to make sure nothing harmful gets in. This is called a mucus plug and it can be loosened and expelled by early contractions, though a lot of folks lose it days or weeks before beginning labor. Then there's this fluid fil bag that the fetus has been hanging out in called the amniotic sack. This usually bursts during the first stage of labor. That's what it means for someone's water to break and it can happen in a gush or a less dramatic trickle. Once the cervix is around 5 to 6 cm dilated and contractions are less than 5 minutes apart, active labor has begun. This is typically more intense and it's what takes the cervix all the way to 10 cm, big enough for the baby's grand entrance. When it comes to delivery, there are a few different methods. We'll start with the most common, vaginal delivery. About seven out of 10 births in the US happen this way. Once the cervix is fully dilated, the second stage of labor kicks off called the pushing stage. If you're delivering, you may feel an urge to push, or your body may push for you. Thanks to something called the fetus ejection reflex. Now, despite a 10 cm hole opening up in the cervix, the vagina still needs to stretch for the fetus to pass through. Nine and 10 first timers report experiencing some kind of vaginal tearing during birth or something called an aesiottomy where a member of the birth team makes a small cut in the vaginal opening. Thankfully, after the shoulders are out, the rest of the body follows pretty fast and voila, a baby. But hang on, because the third stage of birth is the delivery of the placenta. Most people find this part a lot easier than delivering a baby. Now, as for the three out of 10 births that aren't vaginal deliveries, first there's an assisted vaginal delivery where the doctor uses forceps or suction to help pull the baby out. And sometimes a C-section or cesarian birth might be necessary. This is when the doctor makes an incision in the abdomen and uterus and removes the baby that way. There are so many ways that birth happens, but once all is said and done, well, the journey is just beginning. While birth may be over, the fourth trimester has just begun. Also known as the newborn phase, the fourth trimester is those first three months after birth. It is a key stage of development for both baby and parent. And for the person who just gave birth, their body won't be back to business as usual for a while. For the first 6 weeks, the person who gave birth can expect bleeding and cramping as the uterus contracts to its normal size. Cramping also happens because oxytocin, the hormone released during breastfeeding, is the same one that triggers contractions. And while the uterus may remain a little bigger after giving birth, it's a myth that the vagina gets permanently stretched out. For most people, it goes back to its pre-birth shape and size in about 3 to 6 months. Though, doctors do recommend that people who just gave birth pay special attention to any weakening in their pelvic floor, the group of muscles in the pelvis that sort of holds everything together. So, there you go. Pregnancy and childirth in a nutshell, or should I say a uterus. Having a baby is a long complex process where the body undergoes huge changes. It's also something humans have been doing for as long as there have been humans and it's as strange and all inspiring as ever. If you want to learn more, check out the links in the description.

business as usual for a while. for the first 6 weeks, the person who gave birth can expect bleeding and cramping as the uterus contracts to its normal size. cramping also happens because oxytocin, the hormone released during breastfeeding, is the same one that triggers contractions. and while the uterus may remain a little bigger after giving birth, it's a myth that the vagina gets permanently stretched out. for most people, it goes back to its pre-birth shape and size in about 3 to 6 months. though, doctors do recommend that people who just gave birth pay special attention to any weakening in their pelvic floor, the group of muscles in the pelvis that sort of holds everything together. so, there you go. pregnancy and childirth in a nutshell, or should i say a uterus. having a baby is a long complex process where the body undergoes huge changes. it's also something humans have been doing for as long as there have been humans and it's as strange and all inspiring as ever. if you want

XHXC0uOLOkA,Introduction to Native American History: Ep 1 of Crash Course Native American History,"Native American history didn’t begin in 1492, and it didn’t end in 1900. It stretches back thousands and thousands of years and extends into the present – and the future –  of the United States. In our first episode of Crash Course Native American History, we’ll explore why and how we plan to tell this history.

The year of an eclipse. The year the white soldiers attacked. A year of peace. A year of war. This is a winter count. It’s a record of 71 years of Yanktonai history. Each picture represents a notable event between first snowfalls. But this is just a snippet of a much larger timeline. Every tribe has one—a history that’s deep, ongoing, and totally unique. And yet…they’re all unified by one thing. Hi! I'm Che Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [THEME MUSIC] First things first: there’s no way we can tell the entire history of Indigenous people in what’s now the United States. But that doesn’t mean we can’t bridge some gaps and add a little complexity to common understandings. Maybe we’ll even go crazy and fix some misunderstandings. Studies have shown that, across the board in U.S. schools, students aren’t getting much of an education when it comes to Native American History – not by a long shot. As one Navajo/Hopi student wrote in 2019, “ [...] of the U.S. history books used in my classroom, there are 307 pages and only 10 pages talk about Natives.” So yeah, this will be hard. And we won’t cover everything. But we’ll cover a lot of things. We hope to help answer some big questions, leave you curious about others, and really blow your hair back with facts about how Native history has shaped our world today. So let’s start with a word on words. There are over five hundred Native tribes, also called nations, within the U.S. alone. Some are recognized by the federal government, and some aren’t. I’m a member of the Navajo Nation—not to brag. But even that simple statement has layers of nuance. We call ourselves Diné, which means “the people.” Navajo is a name that came about thanks to Europeans. Some Diné folks use the term Navajo; others prefer not to. It’s a “to each their own” situation. Throughout this series, I’ll use specific Native nations’ names. So, if I’m talking about the Kickapoo or the Hualapai or the Chickahominy, you’ll hear me say so — with perfect pronunciation, to boot. Okay, I’ll try my best. And I’ll use the word “Native.” Like, a lot. I might say “Native folks” or “Native people.” But I’ll also say Indigenous. That’s the broadest term for people worldwide who’ve been living in a particular place since before settlers arrived. Like for example, in the U.S., the Aleut, the Chumash, and the Kanaka Maoli? All Indigenous. But the Sámi in places like Norway, the Maya in places like Mexico and Guatemala, and the Ainu in Japan are also all Indigenous. In that way, we’re kind of like cousins. Not by blood — more by vibes. You’ll also sometimes hear me say American Indian— a label that some Indigenous people embrace, and others reject. Pro: it’s been around for a long time. It’s used in U.S. laws, treaties, even the names of federal agencies like the Bureau of Indian Affairs. “Indian” is also just a term older Native people like to use, especially around other Native people. Con? This. Is not. India. Buddy! Another con: Even though any Native could self-identify as an ""American Indian,"" it doesn't ""officially"" include all Indigenous people. That’s because the government only applies the term to members of federally recognized Native nations in the contiguous 48 states, but not Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians. We’ll talk a lot more about what it means to have federal recognition, as well as the status of Natives in Alaska and Hawaii, later in the series. For now, let’s end this vocabulary lesson with Native American. This term came about in the 1960s, as an alternative to “American Indian.” It’s gained a lot of ground as a go-to option. But “Native American” has its own issues! Like, the Americas are all of this business. Maybe even this? Possibly this too, but now we’re getting wild! Of course, this term isn’t preferred everywhere. In Canada, many Indigenous people prefer to be called First Nations or First Peoples, one of three categories alongside Inuit and Métis. In Spanish-speaking Latin America, many prefer “indígenas.” So “Native American” isn’t perfect. But it broadly describes Indigenous people within the U.S. At the end of the day, how Natives choose to identify is very personal! I call myself Indigenous. I also call myself handsome and brave, every morning in front of the mirror. Every Indigenous person has their own preferences when it comes to identity. Though for the record, you’re all brave and handsome. [mumbles] Just not as much as me. The point is, there are no definitive rules on Indigenous terminology — there couldn’t be! Like, remember how I said there are hundreds of Native nations inside the U.S. alone? Well, even that’s complicated! About forty Native nations today have territories split in half by the U.S. border. Like the Kanyen'kehà:ka, or Mohawk Nation of Awkwesasne to the north. Or the Tohono O’odham Nation to the south. And many, many, many Native nations—like the Ho-Chunk— were forced away from their ancestral homelands, and live in a totally different region today. But, with just 24 episodes, we needed to narrow down so we had room to go deep. So, that’s why we’ll be focusing mainly on the history of Native peoples in the United States. And that’s why we’re calling the series Native American History. I fought for the name “A Brave and Handsome History of Native America” but I was not successful. Which brings me to the paradox at the heart of Native American history. On the one hand, there are tons of Native nations with their own unique histories! Their own timelines! There is no single history that we can call Native American History. On the other hand, Native nations share some common experiences, though they’ve happened in different ways, times, and places. Those common experiences are a result of settler-colonialism, a force that binds Native histories together. Remember back in the intro when I said that there’s one thing that unites our histories? This is that thing! Let me break it down. We’ll start with colonialism — that’s where one nation exerts control over another nation and its resources without becoming part of that nation themselves. For example, colonialism describes what happened when the British took over Nigeria in the 19th century, ruling indirectly through local leaders and getting rich off palm oil. Nigerians still lived there, but their lives were never the same. The “settler” part takes this a step beyond. The goal of settler-colonialism is to remove and erase the people already living in a place, so that a new group can move in instead. And this isn’t just describing a single historical event or person. But yes, I’m talking about you. Settler-colonialism describes a system. And the history of the whole United States was shaped by this system. It’s the underlying logic behind centuries of wars, treaties, policies, and laws that affect Native peoples’ lives to this day. That system is part of the reason why basically any question that seems simple is going to be complicated! Like, take this one: “How many Native Americans are there?” Well, before settlers arrived in North America, nobody here called themselves “Indian” or a “Native American.” Those categories didn’t exist! We were kind of just living our lives. But in the 19th century, the federal government created a new, single Native identity, lumping all Native people together as a single “race”. Suddenly, in the words of High School Musical’s Troy Bolton, we were “all in this together.” The government created records of tribal members and assigned each person a blood quantum, or perceived fraction of “Indian blood.” Freaky-sounding term, right? The idea was that, over time, children born to Native families would have lower and lower blood quantums. Thinking of “Indian blood” as something that could be diluted down to zero over generations served the goal of eliminating Native people. First so their land could be taken, and second, to eventually relieve the federal government of its treaty and trust obligations to Natives. But — hi! Hello! — we’re still here! Plan failed! As of the 2020 U.S. Census, about 9.7 million people — or 2.9 percent of the population — self-identified as American Indian or Alaska Native. Though this, too, is…wait for it…complicated. It’s not clear how many of those people were enrolled tribal members, members of tribes the federal government doesn’t recognize, or even just people who’ve heard family stories about their great-great grandma being a Cherokee princess. Settlers have such big imaginations. Anyway, we’ll talk much more about Native identity in Episode 4. For now, let’s talk about what we mean by the “history” part of Native American History. The past five centuries have had an enormous impact on Native nations. But also: the past five centuries are just a blip! About twenty generations! We often use the phrase “since time immemorial” — or the beginning of time itself — to describe Natives’ deep and ongoing presence on this continent. We’re the descendants of the first inhabitants. We’ve been here continuously for thousands of years. Don’t make me math the math on how many generations that is. But when Native American history does get told, it’s usually in a way that begins in 1492 and ends in the late 1800s. Which might give you the impression that history didn’t really begin until Europeans showed up. Or that what happened before is unknowable. Or that Native Americans are mere extras in an A-list drama of the United States, and we mysteriously vanished by the 20th century, only a brief blurb on the nation’s IMDB page. But nah, none of those things are true. Again: hi! Hello! Still here! We made it! The past before European contact is not unknowable. Native peoples’ oral traditions hold knowledge of the past. Like, for generations, the Klamath people have passed down a story about a long-ago volcano that erupted and filled with water, becoming what’s now Crater Lake. And this memory of an ancient eruption? It happened! 7,600 years ago. That was about 1500 years before anyone even started building Stonehenge. Our ancestors were very skilled at gossip. Even gossip about volcanoes. Which is why we’ll include stuff that happened before 1492. We’ll talk about the creation stories, worldviews, and connections to place, food, and ancestors that are thousands of years old and that still endure today, despite settlers’ best efforts to wipe them out. And we’ll also talk about how the settlers’ impact has persisted beyond the 1800s and continues to play out today. Often, you’ll catch me talking about last year and hundreds of years ago in the same breath. Because the past and the present are connected. Way closer than you might think. All wound together, like braids, or DNA, or Twizzlers. ‘Cause when Native American history doesn’t get told, the general public underestimates the ongoing impacts of colonization and discrimination. Native people get written out of the past and the present, too. But it’s time for that to end. Because without Native American history, there would be no U.S. history. The U.S. isn’t even the oldest democracy around here! I see you, Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Native American history is more than a single story. It’s hundreds of timelines across hundreds of nations. Each with their own unique experiences, histories, languages, traditions, and relationships with each other. We’re still here, connected in ways that transcend the attempts to erase us. And we’re shaping what happens next — whether this guy’s ghost likes it or not. [Ghost of Colonial Carl] I do not actually. [Che] I don’t care. In our next episode, we’ll talk about something else every Native nation has in common: sovereignty. I’ll see you then.

First up—they love to DIY, here’s natural methods! They know how to set boundaries—it’s barrier methods! These guys have progestin to give, say hello to hormonal methods! They’re ready to be your emergency contact… Let’s call up emergency methods! They are ready to commit, give a warm welcome to permanent methods! Teen Shan: What’s supposed to be over there? Game show host Shan: Oh, that's the male birth control pill. It hasn’t shown up yet. [Fake audience gasps] Hi, I’m Shan Boodram, this is Crash Course Sex Ed, and today we’re talking about how to not get pregnant. Yeah. [applause] We’ll be right back after these messages. [THEME MUSIC] A quick note on language: We’ll mostly refer to cisgender men and women in this episode, because that’s where most of the research has been done. But trans men and nonbinary people can and do get pregnant, and male birth control is just as important for trans women, as IUDs and pills are for trans men. Regardless of the genders involved, it takes two to make a pregnancy. One limited edition egg, and one tiny, tail-wagging sperm. Contraception is all about finding ways to make sure these two never meet. Or those two. Or… those two. Yeah, there’s a lot of sperm up in here. The typical ejaculation releases nearly two to three hundred million of them. And keeping all those swimmers away from an egg is no easy task. So, how do you do it? Teen Shan: Nadine’s cousin’s neighbor told me to just make sure the guy pulls out before he… y’know. Oh yeah, I do remember hearing that, Teen Shan. Well, more clinically, that’s called withdrawal. During P-in-V sex, someone removes their penis before ejaculation, so the semen goes somewhere outside their partner’s vagina. But there’s a reason it’s often called “pull out and pray.” For one, a guy has to pull out in time. And also, it’s still possible for sperm to be in the pre-ejaculate, the stuff that comes out before semen, especially if he didn't pee before sex. So all said, pulling out can have a one in five chance of failure. Big picture, withdrawal is what we’d call a “natural” method. The other big one is fertility awareness. Sometimes called the rhythm method, it involves a woman tracking and recording her temperature, cervical mucus, or menstrual cycle to predict which days she’s fertile and should avoid sex, or at least use a condom. We’ll talk more about the fertile window in Episode 9. According to sources like the UK’s National Health Service, fertility awareness can be effective. But if it’s not done perfectly, there’s about a one in four chance of failure. This method is difficult to get right, and it’s much tougher if someone’s period isn’t regular or easily tracked. For something more reliable, there’s barrier methods. They’re anything that blocks sperm from the goal, like the ever-popular, always-put-on-a-banana condom. Seriously, condom demonstrations ruined bananas for me. Anyway, barrier methods come in two types: the external kind that rolls on to a penis and traps sperm-filled semen. And the internal kind, which does exactly the same thing, but sits inside a vagina. Condoms are pretty cheap, at most pharmacies, and when used correctly, highly effective at preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. If you always use one perfectly, the World Health Organization estimates that external condoms are about ninety-eight percent effective at preventing pregnancies, while that number for internal condoms is about ninety-five percent. Teen Shan: What about the pill? I heard Nadine’s older sister is on it. Yep, birth control pills are another popular type of contraception. The pill’s an example of a hormonal method, which also includes patches, shots, implants, and many intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Hormonal methods block ovulation, that time once a month when an ovary releases an egg. Two hormones—progestin and sometimes estrogen—can stop ovulation from happening. And they can also make the mucus around the cervix super-sticky, so sperm have a harder time wiggling through. These methods are impermanent but highly effective for a specific amount of time — from twenty-four hours to almost a decade. But not every method works right away. It can take as long as a week for it to become fully effective, depending on the type. Unlike barrier methods, hormonal methods do have side effects, which can vary from person to person, and include things like nausea or headaches. Most go away after about three months, but this also varies between people and between methods. Also, almost all hormonal options require a doctor’s visit. The exception is the mini-pill, which contains only progestin and can be bought over the counter. The mini-pill does have some slightly different risks than the combined pill, though, so like with any of these methods, we highly recommend learning more before deciding what’s right for you. Now, I can not emphasize enough how huge a deal it was when the birth control pill became widely available in the mid-twentieth century. Creating it was a decades-long journey. But unfortunately, some really harmful ideas guided its development. In the 1920s and ‘30s, the movement to develop birth control in the U.S. became all tangled up with eugenics, the false belief that humans could be improved by keeping certain groups of people — including immigrants, disabled folks, and people of color — from having kids. This is civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. In 1961, she had surgery to remove a uterine tumor, but woke to find that her doctor had performed a hysterectomy—her entire uterus had been removed without her consent. This meant she could never get pregnant. Hamer was just one of more than seventy thousand people in the U.S.—mostly Black, Latina, and Native women—who were sterilized against their will under eugenics-inspired policies. In fact, this practice became so common among Black women in the South that Hamer dubbed it a “Mississippi appendectomy.” This was the kind of environment the birth control pill was developed in. Before the FDA approved the first pill, called Enovid, a version that contained more hormones and could have much stronger side effects was tested on women in Puerto Rico, who weren’t warned of the risks or even told they were taking part in a clinical trial. Three women died in the process. The prescription pill eventually hit the market in 1957, which allowed many women unprecedented control over their reproductive decision-making. But as revolutionary as that was, it came from a legacy of women whose reproductive control was taken away from them. Over the decades, new brands of the pill and new varieties of long-acting, reversible contraceptives—or LARCs—have been developed. These are “set it and forget it” options that someone can stop using whenever they want to get pregnant. And in 2024, the first over-the-counter birth control pill in the U.S. became available. But when it comes to hormonal methods like the pill, women often carry most of the responsibility for not getting pregnant. So, why isn’t there a male birth control pill? One reason it doesn’t exist yet is because the bar to prove a contraceptive is safe is higher today than it was in 1960. Good—it should be! But then there’s a less-good reason: there’s not the same sense of urgency to develop a male pill. Women have traditionally been responsible for reproduction, and they already have options. Some researchers also say it’s been harder to lock down the hormone levels that can disarm millions of sperm without risking a lot of side effects. Like, in a 2011 trial, shots of two hormones—progestin and testosterone—were found to be really good at stopping sperm production. But the trial was cut off because of side effects like severe acne, mood swings, and weight gain. Teen Shan: Wait, aren’t those like the same side effects that women can have from the pill? They are. But for women, ethics committees are comparing the side effects from the pill against the health risks of carrying a pregnancy. So, these side effects are deemed acceptable. For cis men, they’re comparing the side effects of those shots against… well, nothing. So, the shots don’t get the green light. Still, there’s been some recent progress toward a male pill. In 2023, researchers discovered a chemical compound that stops sperms’ tails from wagging, so they can’t swim far enough to fertilize an egg. But don’t break out the condom balloons yet! This compound has only been studied in mice. And there’s a long road ahead before it’s part of a male contraceptive. As of 2024, there is a male birth control pill that's in early phases of clinical trials, and there’s also a male birth control gel that's a bit further along in its testing The gel uses both progestin and testosterone so that men using it don’t produce enough sperm to get someone pregnant. And to apply it, they just rub it on their shoulders. Okay! That sounds promising. Alright, fine, we can blow up one condom balloon. So, today, we have natural methods, barrier methods, and hormonal methods. But what happens if one of those methods fail? For that, there’s emergency contraception. One type is the morning after pill, which can be accessed from a doctor, clinic, or pharmacy. It’s most effective within 72 hours of unprotected sex, and it has to be taken within five days to have any chance of working. Some types of emergency contraception are available over the counter in the U.S., so you don’t need a prescription. And that one pill works for one instance of unprotected sex. It’s a misconception that using the morning after pill multiple times will cause fertility issues or other health problems. But it also isn’t meant to be your primary mode of contraception because it’s not as effective as other methods. Certain kinds of IUDs can also be used as emergency contraception. They can block sperm from meeting up with an egg if they’re inserted within five days of unprotected sex, and they continue to offer protection for years to come! But you need to see a doctor for insertion, and it’s not always easy to get an appointment on short notice. Now if you really don’t want to have kids? Like, ever? For that, there’s permanent birth control. For anyone with a uterus, this surgical procedure is often called “getting your tubes tied,” but really it involves either closing or removing pieces of the fallopian tubes, or taking them out altogether. A hysterectomy also falls in this category. For penises, you’ve got the vasectomy. It involves surgically cutting or blocking the vasa deferentia: the little tubes that carry sperm out of the testicles. So you still ejaculate, but the semen is spermless and can’t get anybody pregnant. Both types of permanent birth control are highly effective, but there is a risk of complications. Also, many people — especially women — have found that doctors can be reluctant to perform the procedures, citing things like risks and the possibility of regret. When it comes to contraception, there’s a lot going on here! We may not have male birth control pills yet, but there are still some options for everyone. And if you’re curious about any of the methods we talked about, the best things you can do are talk to a doctor and research contraceptive methods at the links below. Get curious, and you’ll find the answers—and the options—that work best for you. Next time, we’re talking pregnancy and birth. See you then. But first, here’s what you’ve all been waiting for: how to use a condom. Before opening the package, make sure it’s intact by feeling for the air bubble, and check that expiration date. Now, carefully open the condom package, just like this. Take the condom out. You’re going to hold it like this, so it looks like a cute little hat, and place it on the head of the erect penis, pulling back any foreskin, if there is any, or you can place it on a toy. If you accidentally put it on inside-out, you gotta get a whole new condom—otherwise, there could be pre-ejaculate on it, which can contain sperm, bacteria, or viruses. Then, with one hand, pinch the air out of the top, keeping that little tip above the head. That’s where the semen’s gonna go. With the other hand, unroll the whole condom onto the penis, checking that it’s snug, but not too tight. And make sure you’ve got the condom on from the start of sex all the way to the end. After sex is over, while the penis is still hard, hold onto the rim of the condom, then pull out. Then carefully take it off and throw it away. Look at you! You just practiced safer sex.

In words like skunk, squash, and bayou. And if any of that surprises you, well, you’re not alone. Hi! I’m Che Jim, I’m an actor, comedian, educator, activist, and enrolled member of the Navajo Nation. Growing up, I really took to the phrase “laughter is medicine.” It’s been a common saying among Native American people for generations. Laughter creates space, healing, and an opportunity to grow and listen. And, at its core, it’s a form of resiliency and a part of the Native American story — something I’m excited to share with all of you. Between misinformation, stereotypes, and glaring gaps in history classes, it’s common for the average American to have little more than a blurry snapshot of Native American history: one that begins in 1492, and ends in the late 1800s. It’s giving, “Those noble people who aren’t around anymore.” But Native Americans aren’t history. They’re here and now. And anybody who calls these lands “home” should have an understanding of the people who were here first —and still are. In 24 episodes, Crash Course Native American History will explore as many philosophies, stories, and traditions as we can from the hundreds of distinct Native nations in the U.S. And I've got some stories for you— like, have you heard the one about Jessie Little Doe Baird, who brought the language of the Wampanoag people back to life? Or Suzan Shown Harjo, who led the decades-long fight to change the name of Washington, D.C.’s NFL team? I could go on. We’ll also cover some Native Identity 101: like, what does it mean to be a citizen of a Native nation today? And, yes, we’ll talk about what happened after 1492, tracing how we got from treaties to reservations to modern tribal governments. And we couldn’t have done this alone! We worked with a team of Native experts: scholars in federal Indian policy, curriculum developers, artists, and of course me, your host. So, let’s meet back here next week.

",US,16800000,1661,2025-04-24,2025,587,9.783333333333331,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Fon62HgOk,"Here’s the deal: It’s normal to be freaked out by sexually transmitted infections. No disease is ever fun, and they can be even less fun when they have to do with sex. But actually? STIs are avoidable, treatable, and preventable. So let’s cover the facts. Because just a few key pieces of information can help you have a safer sex life. Hi! I'm Shan Boodram and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] Where there are humans, there are germs. We sneeze, we get our hands dirty, and sometimes, we get sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, which are infections that can be spread through sexual contact. In fact, in 2018 the CDC estimated that over sixty-seven million people in the U.S. had an STI, with about twenty million new cases every year. And almost half of those new cases showed up in people between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four. When it comes to STIs, there are a lot of myths out there. Here’s a big one: “STIs are so common because they’re hard to prevent and treat.” Actually, most are pretty easy to avoid, but many people just don’t know how to prevent them. And most are also easy to treat. For the few that aren’t curable, there are options to minimize their impact on your life and make sure you don’t pass them on. So, let’s get into it. Most STIs can be put into one of two categories: bacterial or viral. The most common bacterial STIs are gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. They’re spread through bodily fluids or direct contact with a rash or sore during unprotected sex. And by “fluids,” I don’t just mean semen: Depending on the STI, “fluids” can also mean vaginal fluids, preejaculate, or saliva, and these can be exchanged through penetration, oral sex, anal sex, sex toys, or even just rubbing genitals against each other. Luckily, we’ve got a highly effective solution: wrap it up. No, not that kind of wrap. This kind of wrap. Thank you. One of the easiest ways to avoid catching an STI is to use a barrier method of protection, which prevents direct contact. Like external condoms for penises, internal condoms that go inside a vagina or anus, and dental dams, which can be placed over a vulva or an anus before engaging in oral sex. And because sex toys can also spread bacteria and STIs, it’s important to clean those after every use, usually with hot water and antibacterial soap. Condoms can also help make them safer, especially with new or multiple partners. But while barrier methods are really good at preventing STIs, they’re not perfect—they can malfunction, and there can be user error. That’s why STI testing and open dialogue among partners is so important. You can even make it flirty! “Show me your results and I’ll show you mine.” Now, if you do get a bacterial STI, there is a really effective cure for them: antibiotics. There are even preventative antibiotics, like the one called Doxycycline that someone can take up to seventy-two hours after a barrier method fails, or if they don’t use one. But they’re not meant to replace barrier methods. And at the time of recording this video, Doxycycline is only recommended for cis-men and transwomen. As for when to seek treatment? Sometimes, it’s clear that something is up down there — pain, unusual discharge, sores, or even flu-like symptoms with syphilis in particular. But there’s also this other myth floating around: that if you don’t have any symptoms, you don’t need to worry about having an STI. Here’s the truth, though: most STIs are asymptomatic, meaning someone might not notice having any symptoms at all. Teen Shan: So I could get an STI and not even know it? Mhmm. That’s why it’s so important to get tested regularly, especially if you’re having sex with multiple partners, or the person you’re having sex with is having sex with other people. Because even when someone isn’t showing symptoms, they’re still able to pass on the infection to someone else. And a long-term infection, even an asymptomatic one, can lead to irreversible damage to the reproductive organs. And hot tip: don’t just assume your doctor is testing you for STIs if they take your blood or urine sample. If you want an STI test, you gotta ask for it. And if you don’t feel like you can ask your regular doctor, you can check out your local Department of Health, Planned Parenthood, or another STI testing option near you. Now, bacterial STIs aren’t the only ones out there. There are also STIs caused by viruses. And unlike their bacterial cousins, viral STIs can’t be cured—but medications can keep symptoms in check. The most common viral STIs are herpes; Human Papillomavirus, aka HPV; hepatitis B; and Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. All of these can be transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person, so barrier methods are a key part of preventing them. But what does it look like if you do get one? Let’s start with herpes. There are two kinds. HSV-1 usually causes cold sores on the mouth, while HSV-2 usually causes sores around the genitals. Either way, the virus is most often transmitted by contact with sores, but it can also happen even when none are visible. Once someone gets it, the herpes virus is there for keeps. It can go dormant for long periods of time and then pop back up in times of stress or when their immune system is otherwise compromised. So, folks with herpes won’t always have sores but may experience “recurrences.” But even though herpes isn’t curable, it is very treatable. There are prescription medications that can help manage flare-ups and put the infection back into dormancy. Up next, there’s HPV. Unlike the two kinds of herpes, there are over two hundred different kinds of HPV. Which sounds scary, but for the vast majority of people, their immune system will clear out an HPV infection pretty quickly. There are a few strains that can stick around and cause genital warts, and other strains can cause cells at the site of infection to behave in a way that can lead to cancer. High-risk HPV strains most commonly cause cervical cancer, but can also cause other cancers. The good news is, there’s an HPV vaccine. And it’s so effective that in places where it’s been rolled out, researchers have seen drastic decreases in cervical cancer in the decades that followed. Your doctor can give you more information on the vaccine if you’re interested, or check your records to see if you already got it. And there’s also a vaccine for Hepatitis B, which is transmitted through fluids from unprotected sex or sharing needles. And speaking of life-saving science, here’s a viral STI you might have heard about before: HIV. This was once a deadly disease, but now it’s considered a chronic, manageable illness for those who are able to access care—and it can be prevented, too. HIV damages a person’s immune system, making it hard to fight everyday infections, and it can sometimes lead to an ongoing condition called AIDS. Although not everyone living with HIV develops AIDS. In the U.S., gay and bisexual men are the group most affected by HIV, but it can affect people of any sexual orientation, and be transmitted through many kinds of sex — or no sex at all, like through an infected needle. That said, anal sex is significantly riskier for the transmission of HIV than vaginal sex. That’s because anal and rectal tissue is thin, allowing the virus increased access to the bloodstream. While I can’t stress enough how important condoms are, there’s an added option for HIV prevention: For people who are at higher risk of being exposed, their doctor can prescribe a medication called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is taken as a daily pill or a bimonthly injection. When it’s taken properly, PrEP reduces the risk of getting sexually transmitted HIV up to ninety-nine percent. There are also medications that can be taken if someone thinks they were exposed to HIV. If taken within seventy-two hours of contact, it can prevent infection. These are called post-exposure prophylaxis drugs, or PEP. Some people think that PrEP and PEP are only for gay men, but that’s not true! STIs do not discriminate based on sexual orientation. And if someone is HIV positive? There are medications like antiretroviral therapy that can help them live a normal, healthy, and long life, and prevent them from passing the disease on to others. And scientists around the world are working hard to develop an effective HIV vaccine. Unfortunately, though, there’s still serious stigma around HIV in most cultures. That means medicines like PrEP and PEP — as well as programs to help people afford them — may not be talked about. So, some people are speaking up to change that. Teen Shan, let ’em know. This is the famed, the fabulous, the ever-fashionable Billy Porter. He was diagnosed HIV-positive in 2007, and kept it private for more than a decade. In the religious family he grew up in, HIV was considered a punishment from God. And as an actor, there was a chance his disease would prevent him from getting work. But in 2021, he took his diagnosis public. “There’s no more stigma,” he said in an interview. “Let’s be done with that.” And Porter’s joined by others with HIV in stopping the stigma, from NBA star Magic Johnson, to “Queer Eye” host Jonathan van Ness. As Van Ness put it on social media, “We have come a long way in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but there is so much work left to be done.” So, getting an STI doesn’t have to be a world-shattering thing — or something to be ashamed of. Overall, understanding how to prevent STIs, being aware of your own body, and communicating with your partners and your doctor are key. We’re all just trying to help each other live our safest, healthiest sex lives. Ooh! Speaking of prevention — next time, we’re talking about contraception. See you then.

[gasps] Hi, I’m Shan Boodram, this is Crash Course Sex Ed, and today we’re talking about virginity: is it really a thing? We’ll be back right after these messages. [THEME MUSIC] When someone thinks “virgin,” their mind often goes to the only sex act that can make a baby: penis-in-vagina. Which is complicated, since that’s not what all sex looks like, but it’s where we’ll camp out for today. Nobody knows exactly when we started caring about virginity, but a leading theory is that it goes all the way back to the invention of farming. Which sounds like I made it up, but I swear I’m not messing with you. Farming coincided with the invention of property. So suddenly, ownership mattered: my land, my crops, my stuff—and, hold on, which one of these kids is mine? In these patriarchal societies, “Who’s your daddy?” was an important question. And the only way for men to be sure about their biological dadhood was to invent a system where women were expected to reserve sex for their husbands. Old MacDonald had a farm... and control over his wife's sex life. Over the centuries, virginity became a whole thing in the West, embedded in everything from artwork and religion to laws and teen movies. And premarital virginity became such a prized quality in women, people were like, “No no no no, we can’t just take her word for it. We need to prove that she’s telling the truth.” In 17th-century England, people theorized you could tell a virgin from the proportions of her neck. Before that, in Renaissance Europe, it was thought that a virgin could be sussed out based on the clarity of her pee. And of course, virginity detectives have long honed in on the hymen. Don’t know her? She’s a thin membrane near the opening of the vagina. Literally just some tissue left over after the vagina forms during fetal development. You may have heard that the hymen breaks—like the seal on a jar—the first time a person with a vagina has P-in-V sex. Changing them physically forever. But it doesn’t work like that. And it’s nothing like popping a cherry, so let’s just ban that phrase forever. Some people with vaginas don’t have much of a hymen to begin with. And for those who do, that tissue often thins away way before they’re sexually active, from exercising, riding a bike, using a tampon, or just existing. Many people never know their hymen’s there, much less when it’s gone. Still, this myth is so globally pervasive that some parents still ask doctors to “test” their child’s virginity by checking the hymen and the stretchiness of the vagina… but according to medical experts, neither of those things tell you anything about whether that person has had sex. The vagina doesn’t permanently stretch out the first, or any of the times that someone has sex. The va-jay-jay is like a rubber band; it just bounces back. Trust me on that one, I birthed two babies. It’s also a myth that a person with a vagina always bleeds or experiences pain the first time they have sex. It can happen, but not always. And it might have nothing to do with the hymen. Discomfort can happen for lots of reasons, including tension, position, speed, or not being lubricated enough—even if it’s your three-thousandth time. Sex doesn’t have to be painful, and if it is, your doctor can help you out with that. All of this is to say: virginity is not a medical reality. There’s no physical way of telling whether a person has had penis-in-vagina sex—not from the hymen any more than from the earlobe. So if virginity isn’t a physical state of being, what is it? Think of virginity like money. It’s real in the sense that some people care a lot about it, and it impacts our lives — I mean, having sex for the first time is a real experience. And it can be a big moment in someone’s life! But the value we assign to virginity? That’s something that cultures have just made up. More specifically, virginity is an example of a sexual script—one of the many social expectations about how to behave when it comes to sex. This idea was first proposed in the 1960s by sociologists John Gagnon and William Simon, who argued that human sexuality is less driven by biological instincts than the social meanings we create. You can think of scripts like stage directions in a given time and place. Like, if you send me the eggplant emoji, I’m gonna think you’re flirting. Sexual scripts train people in what’s “normal” or “correct” sexual behavior, and they often interact with scripts for gender—society’s type-cast roles for men and women. On top of that, traditional sexual scripts in the West are highly heteronormative, presuming that only men and women have sex with each other. Oh, and those women sharing a life together? Yeah, they’re just roommates. Like, here’s a sexual script you might have heard before: Men mainly care about the physical parts of sex, and the emotional relationship with their partner… well that’s less important. Meanwhile, for women, it’s all about the emotions. But those traditional scripts aren’t for everybody, and if they don’t work for you, you can write your own story. Especially when the scripts handed to you do more harm than good. For example, multiple studies have found that women living in cultures that prize virginity are often more reluctant to have conversations about sexual health or access certain types of healthcare. Take Pap smears. They involve swabbing the cervix to check for cancerous cells, and are recommended for everyone with a vagina who’s over twenty-one. But in cultures that value purity, some women avoid getting the procedure, thinking it’ll threaten their status as a virgin or reveal that they have had P-in-V sex. And like we talked about in Episode 4, gendered sexual scripts often cast people in rigid roles they didn’t choose. Like, that script about men not prioritizing emotional intimacy? That starts developing early, as boys get cast in gender roles that go something like: “Explore! Be assertive! But don’t talk about feelings!” Compare that with the script traditionally handed to girls: “Settle down! Be careful! Think of others’ feelings!” Growing up with these scripts can shape our expectations, creating miscommunications that make it seem like men and women are innately different. So different they might as well be from different planets, a claim made by the 1992 book ""Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"". In it, you’ll find statements like: men like the news, the weather, gadgets, gizmos, and uniforms. Women care about feelings, beauty, relationships, and wearing a different outfit every day. But these claims aren’t well supported by research. The gender similarities hypothesis, proposed by psychologist Janet Hyde, asserts that men and women are more alike than they are different. In a study on areas where men and women are often assumed to part ways, like math skills and the gift of gab, Hyde found no statistically significant differences. When it came to sexuality, the largest gender differences were frequency of masturbation and attitudes toward casual sex. But how much of that ties into sexual scripts? Some researchers have also pointed out that boys are taught to touch their genitals from an early age so they can aim while peeing, which can lead to more exploration, and more experience with what feels good to them. “For kids your age it’s just something normal” Meanwhile, girls are often taught that their vulva is something they shouldn’t touch. [TV test sound effect] And can we really talk about attitudes toward casual sex without addressing the virgin script in the room? That gendered double-standard that tells girls it’s shameful to have sex while telling boys it’s shameful to be a virgin? Or how about the flip that happens as we get older, from “Oh my gosh, you’re too young to have sex!” to “What do you mean you haven’t done it yet?” Either way, decades of research show that these narrow scripts are not good for us. The good news is, these scripts don’t have to be your story. Your culture hands you a draft, not a blueprint of how to live your life. Even people who like the traditional script may find it limiting at some point—like when a man needs to cry, or a woman wants to enjoy some casual sex without getting branded with a scarlet letter! So, go ahead: Edit them, scribble in the margins, write your own plot. For years, I was told that my first experience of P-in-V sex was “bad” because it didn’t look like most people’s. And it wasn't until I took a big ol' red marker to the virginity script that I was able to own and appreciate my story. And the more freedom we grant each other to write our own stories, the better off we all are. So is virginity really a thing? Well, it isn’t a physical absolute, and it doesn’t have any inherent value. It’s one of the many scripts our culture hands to us. But those aren’t objective truths, and you get to decide which parts you want to keep, and which parts you want to write yourself. Next time, we’re busting myths about STIs. See you then.

in these patriarchal societies,  who s your daddy?  was an important question. and the only way for men to be sure about their biological dadhood was to invent a system where women were expected to reserve sex for their husbands. old macdonald had a farm. and control over his wife's sex life. over the centuries, virginity became a whole thing in the west, embedded in everything from artwork and religion to laws and teen movies. and premarital virginity became such a prized quality in women, people were like,  no no no no, we can t just take her word for it. we need to prove that she s telling the truth.  in 17th-century england, people theorized you could tell a virgin from the proportions of her neck. before that, in renaissance europe, it was thought that a virgin could be sussed out based on the clarity of her pee. and of course, virginity detectives have long honed in on the hymen. don t know her?

But despite that small detail, I genuinely believed we were made for each other. And that crush was followed by a cascade of crushes. When I was a preteen, I used to serenade the boy band posters on my walls. You could say I was boy-obsessed. But why is that? Why have I always been into guys instead of girls? And why are some people into both, or neither? And why does it even matter? Hi! I’m Shan Boooooodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] When I talk about the people that we’re into, I’m talking about sexual orientation—if men, women, neither, or both make you all sweaty and weak in the knees. Sexual orientation might line up with who someone’s actually having sex with, or how they publicly identify, or it might not, for lots of reasons. We talked about that more in Episode 1. For now, though, here’s the big thing to know: Sexual orientation exists on a spectrum—not just two opposites, but all the possibilities in-between. So, on one end of the spectrum, if you’re straight, that means you’re a woman who’s exclusively attracted to men, or a man who’s exclusively attracted to women. It’s the same as being heterosexual, the prefix “hetero” meaning “other.” Now, on the other end, if you’re lesbian or gay, you’re a woman who’s exclusively attracted to women, or a man who’s exclusively attracted to men. Both can be considered homosexual, the prefix “homo” meaning “same”—although that term can be seen as dated. But there are tons of other sexual identities in-between those two, often lumped together under the “LGBTQIA+” umbrella. Teen Shan: Should I say all the letters one by one like that? Or should I pronounce it like eljibbitycueaiah? Shan: Definitely one by one. We’re gonna get into that acronym a bit later, because it hasn’t been around forever. But when it comes to all the variation in human sexuality? That’s been documented for centuries. Diversity in sexuality was the norm in various cultures across the ancient world, from China to Egypt to Rome. Alexander the Great famously had both male and female lovers. But right now, it’s illegal to be gay in sixty-four countries, and in twelve of those, it’s punishable by life in prison or even death. And even in countries where being gay is legal, like the U.S., it’s not universally accepted. So what happened? Well, different prejudices around same-sex intercourse have existed for ages, driven by religion and cultural beliefs. But the fire really sparked soon after Christianity came to ancient Rome, thanks to scripture prohibiting it. And in the 1200s, Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas fanned the flames, claiming that same-sex intercourse was against the natural order of things God had created. This idea that homosexual behavior is “unnatural” spread even further as a result of Christian missionary work and European colonization. And it’s been doing damage for more than eight hundred years. Like, flash forward to the 1950s, when the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Medical Disorders, the guide psychiatrists use to make diagnoses, was first published. It didn’t call homosexuality a sin, but it did carry on the prejudices of the past by classifying it as a mental illness. It took decades for that classification to be undone, thanks to a psychiatrist in disguise. Teen Shan, let ’em know. The year was 1972. Members of the American Psychiatric Association had gathered for their annual conference in Dallas, Texas. Several people sat on a panel about psychiatry and homosexuality… including someone wearing a costume and a Richard Nixon mask: Dr. Anonymous. “I am a homosexual,” he said into a microphone that distorted his voice. “I am a psychiatrist.” Leading up to the conference, lesbian activists Kay Tobin Lahusen and Barbara Gittings had searched endlessly for a gay psychiatrist who’d be willing to speak on the panel to help destigmatize their own sexuality. But doing so could jeopardize their careers, so many turned them down. Except for Dr. John Fryer, a gay psychiatrist who had lost a residency position because of his sexual orientation. He agreed to be the voice of gay psychiatrists on the panel—if he could protect his identity. During his speech, he spoke directly to the closeted psychiatrists in the room, saying that though coming out would be risky, quote, “We are taking an even bigger risk … not accepting fully our own humanity, with all the lessons it has to teach all the other humans around us.” His speech made an impact: the following year, homosexuality was removed as a mental illness from the DSM. And twenty years later, Dr. Fryer revealed himself as Dr. Anonymous. So homosexuality is not a mental illness. But that still doesn’t answer our big question: why do we like who we like? Is it because we’re born this way? Is there a code in my DNA that made me so boy-obsessed? Well, it’s not as simple as that, but scientists have found evidence that DNA and sexual orientation seem to be related. They can’t say that DNA causes anyone to be gay, straight, or anything else — but some studies have found evidence that there is a connection. Like, studies that followed identical twins found that if one twin was gay, there was a small, increased likelihood that the other twin was as well. And big picture, a 2019 study found that hundreds or even thousands of genes may contribute to a person’s sexual orientation, and which of those genes gets turned on or off is probably strongly influenced by internal factors, like hormones we’re exposed to — not just in the womb, but also later during puberty. So, biology might be part of the story. But it’s also more complicated than Lady Gaga’s “born this way.” One thing we know thanks to sexological research is that who we’re attracted to isn’t always fixed: It can change and shift throughout our lives. This is called sexual fluidity, and it means that if you’re attracted to one gender now, it doesn’t mean you could never be attracted to another gender in the future. And surveys have found that those shifts might happen for various personal, social, or environmental reasons that aren’t related to genetics. That said, evidence shows that sexual orientation can’t be forcibly changed. Notably, thousands of young LGBTQ+ people have undergone conversion therapy: treatments to try and make them heterosexual. This can involve medication, talk therapy, humiliation, and much more. But conversion therapy has been renounced by a long list of medical and psychotherapy associations, including the American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association — not only because it’s ineffective, but because multiple studies have found that it’s associated with mental health risks. Ultimately, why we like who we like is complicated. Throughout the centuries, the way some societies have viewed sexual orientation has changed. And so have the ways people have talked about it. Which brings us back to that big ol’ acronym from the beginning. It started with LG — the lesbian and gay community — but has expanded over the years, with different identities being acknowledged. The B stands for bisexual. Teen Shan: I know what that means. It’s being attracted to girls and guys. Shan: Well, yes and no. Some people see it that way, but others see bisexuality as encompassing more than the gender binary, including attraction to nonbinary and trans people. And other folks choose to identify as pan- or omnisexual, “pan” and “omni” meaning “all.” The T and I are for “transgender” and “intersex"", which we talked about in episode 4. The Q has two meanings: “questioning,” which helps those who may not be sure of their sexualities feel welcome in the group. And “queer,” which is often used today as an umbrella term for the whole community, or as a way of not strictly labeling someone’s sexual orientation. Teen Shan: Uh, Shan… even I know that word’s not cool to say. Shan: Well, good point— “queer” has been used as a slur in the past, though today, many in the community have reclaimed it as a term for self-identity. But that isn’t true everywhere, so be careful about using the term, especially if you don’t identify that way yourself. The A stands for asexual. This term encompasses the ace spectrum, people who experience low or no sexual attraction. For example, demisexual people only experience sexual attraction if they’re already very close with a person. And finally, you’ve got the plus, which includes all the many additional sexual orientations people experience, and the words they use to describe them. Now, this acronym isn’t perfect. Some folks think it’s too clunky, or that it normalizes straightness by lumping all the “other” people into one big group. But lots of people find it useful for building community, especially when they’re fighting oppression and injustice against different marginalized identities. As for how many people are in this big ol’ group? As of 2021, based on census data, the Human Rights Campaign estimated that there may be as many as 20 million LGBTQ+ adults in the United States alone. So yeah, that’s why pride parades are so lit. In the end, we might not know exactly why we’re into the people we’re into — but as a society, we’ve definitely decided that it matters. Once, people wrote the story that being anything other than straight is wrong, and today, many others are working hard to unwrite it. Because variation in sexual orientation and behavior has always been around. And our understanding of it will just keep on growing and evolving as we do. Next time, we’re asking another big question: is virginity even a thing? We’ll see you then.

that s been documented for centuries. diversity in sexuality was the norm in various cultures across the ancient world, from china to egypt to rome. alexander the great famously had both male and female lovers. but right now, it s illegal to be gay in sixty-four countries, and in twelve of those, it s punishable by life in prison or even death. and even in countries where being gay is legal, like the u.s., it s not universally accepted. so what happened? well, different prejudices around same-sex intercourse have existed for ages, driven by religion and cultural beliefs. but the fire really sparked soon after christianity came to ancient rome, thanks to scripture prohibiting it. and in the 1200s, christian philosopher thomas aquinas fanned the flames, claiming that same-sex intercourse was against the natural order of things god had created. this idea that homosexual behavior is  unnatural  spread even further as a result of christian missionary work and european colonization. and it s been doing damage for more than eight hundred years. like, flash forward to the 1950s, when the diagnostic and statistical manual of medical disorders, the guide psychiatrists use to make diagnoses, was first published. it didn t call homosexuality a sin, but it did carry on the prejudices of the past by classifying it as a mental illness. it took decades for that classification to be undone, thanks to a psychiatrist in disguise. teen shan, let  em know. the year was 1972. members of the american psychiatric association had gathered for their annual conference in dallas, texas. several people sat on a panel about psychiatry and homosexuality  including someone wearing a costume and a richard nixon mask  dr. anonymous.  i am a homosexual,  he said into a microphone that distorted his voice.  i am a psychiatrist.  leading up to the conference, lesbian activists kay tobin lahusen and barbara gittings had searched endlessly for a gay psychiatrist who d be willing to speak on the panel to help destigmatize their own sexuality. but doing so could jeopardize their careers, so many turned them down. except for dr. john fryer, a gay psychiatrist who had lost a residency position because of his sexual orientation. he agreed to be the voice of gay psychiatrists on the panel if he could protect his identity. during his speech, he spoke directly to the closeted psychiatrists in the room, saying that though coming out would be risky, quote,  we are taking an even bigger risk   not accepting fully our own humanity, with all the lessons it has to teach all the other humans around us.  his speech made an impact  the following year, homosexuality was removed as a mental illness from the dsm. and twenty years later, dr. fryer revealed himself as dr. anonymous. so homosexuality is not a mental illness. but that still doesn t answer our big question  why do we like who we like? is it because we re born this way? is there a code in my dna that made me so boy-obsessed? well, it s not as simple as that, but scientists have found evidence that dna and sexual orientation seem to be related. they can t say that dna causes anyone to be gay, straight, or anything else   but some studies have found evidence that there is a connection. like, studies that followed identical twins found that if one twin was gay, there was a small, increased likelihood that the other twin was as well. and big picture, a 2019 study found that hundreds or even thousands of genes may contribute to a person s sexual orientation, and which of those genes gets turned on or off is probably strongly influenced by internal factors, like hormones we re exposed to   not just in the womb, but also later during puberty. so, biology might be part of the story. but it s also more complicated than lady gaga s  born this way.  one thing we know thanks to sexological research is that who we re attracted to isn t always fixed  it can change and shift throughout our lives. this is called sexual fluidity, and it means that if you re attracted to one gender now, it doesn t mean you could never be attracted to another gender in the future. and surveys have found that those shifts might happen for various personal, social, or environmental reasons that aren t related to genetics. that said, evidence shows that sexual orientation can t be forcibly changed. notably, thousands of young lgbtq  people have undergone conversion therapy  treatments to try and make them heterosexual. this can involve medication, talk therapy, humiliation, and much more. but conversion therapy has been renounced by a long list of medical and psychotherapy associations, including the american psychiatric association and the american medical association   not only because it s ineffective, but because multiple studies have found that it s associated with mental health risks. ultimately, why we like who we like is complicated. throughout the centuries, the way some societies have viewed sexual orientation has changed. and so have the ways people have talked about it. which brings us back to that big ol  acronym from the beginning. it started with lg   the lesbian and gay community   but has expanded over the years, with different identities being acknowledged. the b stands for bisexual. teen shan  i know what that means. it s being attracted to girls and guys. shan  well, yes and no. some people see it that way, but others see bisexuality as encompassing more than the gender binary, including attraction to nonbinary and trans people. and other folks choose to identify as pan- or omnisexual,  pan  and  omni  meaning  all.  the t and i are for  transgender  and  intersex"", which we talked about in episode 4. the q has two meanings   questioning,  which helps those who may not be sure of their sexualities feel welcome in the group. and  queer,  which is often used today as an umbrella term for the whole community, or as a way of not strictly labeling someone s sexual orientation. teen shan  uh, shan  even i know that word s not cool to say. shan  well, good point   queer  has been used as a slur in the past, though today, many in the community have reclaimed it as a term for self-identity. but that isn t true everywhere, so be careful about using the term, especially if you don t identify that way yourself. the a stands for asexual. this term encompasses the ace spectrum, people who experience low or no sexual attraction. for example, demisexual people only experience sexual attraction if they re already very close with a person. and finally, you ve got the plus, which includes all the many additional sexual orientations people experience, and the words they use to describe them. now, this acronym isn t perfect. some folks think it s too clunky, or that it normalizes straightness by lumping all the  other  people into one big group. but lots of people find it useful for building community, especially when they re fighting oppression and injustice against different marginalized identities. as for how many people are in this big ol  group? as of 2021, based on census data, the human rights campaign estimated that there may be as many as 20 million lgbtq  adults in the united states alone. so yeah, that s why pride parades are so lit. in the end, we might not know exactly why we re into the people we re into   but as a society, we ve definitely decided that it matters. once, people wrote the story that being anything other than straight is wrong, and today, many others are working hard to unwrite it. because variation in sexual orientation and behavior has always been around. and our understanding of it will just keep on growing and evolving as we do. next time, we re asking another big question  is virginity even a thing? we ll see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was produced in partnership with the kinsey institute at indiana university. if you re interested in learning more, visit their website for resources that explore the topics we discussed in the video today. thanks for watching this episode, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis and was made with all the help of these fabulous people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone, forever, you can join our community on patreon.",10228,1781

Who you know yourself to be on the inside doesn’t match who people assume you are from the outside. What steps would you take to fix that? Would you change your name? Your clothes? Your body? And which of those steps would be the one that made you feel like… you? That’s the experience for many transgender people—who are assigned a gender at birth that’s different from the way they know themselves. So let’s talk about what it really means to transition. Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] No matter what color confetti exploded at their gender reveal party, someone’s genitals aren’t their destiny. They’re also not their gender —the socially constructed roles and behaviors often expected of us. And genitals aren’t even the end-all, be-all of sex, a classification based on physical traits that involves genitals, but also hormones and genes. Sex is often treated like a fork in the road: male or female, penis or vagina. But in reality, the possibilities look a lot more like a New York City subway map. So, let’s take a look at the map! The egg and the sperm that made you went halfsies on all your chromosomes, the bundles of DNA that make you you. And it’s mainly the 23rd chromosome pair that affects your sex development. From the egg, you get an X chromosome. And from the sperm, you usually get either another X, making you XX. Or a Y, making you XY. At about six weeks, an XX embryo usually starts developing what doctors would consider female reproductive organs: ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina. And an XY embryo usually has a gene that turns on like: “grow a pair.” The embryo develops testes, those testes start secreting testosterone, and voila, more male reproductive organs: a prostate and a penis. There’s a whole lot more on how all this works in Crash Course Biology. Notice how I keep saying usually? That’s because some people are born intersex: with a blend of male and female traits, because of differences in their chromosomes or hormones. Like, an XX person might have testes, because the “grow a pair” gene that’s usually on the Y was on the X instead. Or an XY person might produce the usual levels of testosterone, but have hormone receptors that don’t respond to it with typical male development. There are a lot of different ways someone can be intersex! And those paths are more common than you think—about seventeen in every thousand people are born intersex. With about eight billion people on the planet in 2024, that’s— carry the two—yeah, 136 million people. Teen Shan: Wow, that’s more than three times the population of Canada! Wild, huh? But because there’s this expectation that everybody’s got either a penis or a vagina, intersex people are often put through medically unnecessary surgeries when they’re very young so their bodies look closer to what’s deemed “normal.” In any case, sex is only about the body you’re born with, not the person you become. It’s mostly about the “bits.” But as a society, you might say we’re committed to the bits. We use people’s anatomy to make assumptions about what they’re like, or how they’re supposed to act. And all those socially constructed ideas swirling around us? That’s gender. And gender identity is your inner sense of who you are, which could be a man, a woman, a blend of both, or neither. If you’re cisgender, your sex, your gender identity, and the gender assigned to you at birth are the same. But for everyone else, things aren’t so straightforward. A transgender person’s gender identity doesn’t match the gender they were assigned at birth based on their sex. For example, they were assigned male but identify as a girl. And a nonbinary person’s gender identity doesn’t fit neatly into either of the boxes, so they opt out of the gender binary altogether. Many nonbinary people also identify as transgender, but that’s up to the individual. For some folks, it takes years—or even decades—to recognize and put a name to those feelings. But for many, gender identity starts forming from an early age. I have a three-year-old who’s very curious about anatomy and gender, so this conversation comes up a lot in my house. Which is typical, because by three or four, it’s common for both cis and trans kids to say “I’m a girl” or “I’m a boy,” and to prefer same-gender friends, plus clothes and toys stereotypical for their gender. So even if a trans girl assigned “male” at birth is treated like a boy, she’s still developing an inner sense of “girl.” She’s paying close attention to social messages about what girls like and what girls do: messages like “only girls wear dresses and love pink.” But especially if you’re more of a jumpsuit gal, or a guy who rocks pink nail polish, you’ll know that that message—“only girls wear dresses and love pink”—is not an objective statement of reality. It’s a gender norm: a socially constructed idea about how people of different genders should look and act. Gender norms are everywhere, and they can be strong. A norm can feel as unquestionable as gravity, even if it’s just a thing people made up in a certain time and place. Like, during the 19th century, dresses were for anybody under the age of six. See this cutie in a little sundress? That’s future President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Even the idea that there are only two genders — also known as a gender binary — is a norm that not every culture co-signs. Many Native American tribes have traditionally recognized a third gender, often known by the pan-tribal term “Two-Spirit,” for people who embody both male and female qualities. Many Pacific Islander cultures also recognize a third gender—like the Māhū in Native Hawaiian tradition, meaning “the in-between.” And in Sāmoa, third and fourth gender people called fa‘afafine and fa’atama have the special role as a family caregiver, including being someone who can educate others about sex, a topic considered taboo for men and women to discuss publicly. If the idea that there are only two genders feels “normal” or “natural,” it might be because that idea was deliberately spread for centuries through the world’s worst road trip: European colonialism. While seizing peoples’ land, colonizers often suppressed and punished those who didn’t align with the two genders Europeans thought were correct. So the idea that there are only two genders is just that—an idea that people created to organize the world around them. But while putting stuff in boxes is great when you’re moving and have to separate your nightstand necessities from your kitchenware, it usually doesn’t work for people. So what happens when the box you’re put into doesn’t match who you are on the inside? Some people act on that feeling by going through a gender transition—choosing to live according to their gender identity—which can look like many things. For some, transitioning might look like changing their name or pronouns. For others, it might mean switching up their hair, their clothes, the way they talk. [Ash Perez] “I’m Ashly Perez, and I’m a hunky dude. And I’m 1 day on T.” “I’m Ashly Perez, and I’m a hunky dude. And I’m 16 weeks on T.” [Shan] And some transgender people—but not all—might choose to transition by making physical changes to their body. One pathway for that is gender affirming hormone therapy. This might involve things like testosterone or estrogen shots, which trigger physical changes similar to puberty, so that someone’s body changes to be more in line with their gender identity. Hormone replacement therapy is generally only prescribed to people over eighteen—or occasionally, someone in their late teens who has identified as trans for years, with approval from a doctor and their parents. As for young kids? Before puberty, a trans kid’s transition is primarily social, including things like their name, their pronouns, and their style. However, as puberty approaches, some trans kids might be prescribed a different kind of hormone therapy medication, called puberty blockers: medications that pause the changes that don’t align with their gender identity — things like facial hair, breast development, or a deeper voice. Puberty blockers have been tested and used safely for decades. And their effects are temporary—as soon as someone stops taking them, puberty revs up again. Finally, for some people, transitioning can involve surgery to their face or body, to create more masculine or feminine features that better align with their gender identity. You might hear this called “top” or “bottom” surgery, when it involves operating on someone’s chest or genitals. These surgeries have been done on people of all genders safely for decades — like how a cisgender woman might get breast reconstruction surgery after a mastectomy. And although there’s a common myth that trans people often regret getting gender-affirming surgery, research has shown that it’s very rare. All of these interventions fall under a holistic healthcare approach called gender-affirming care, which helps folks align their outward traits with their inner identity. In the vast majority of cases, gender-affirming care is safe, and it’s backed by decades of research and by almost every major medical organization in the U.S., including the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association. Gender-affirming care can also be life-saving, since it can help with the distress many trans and nonbinary people feel over the mismatch between their actual gender and their assigned one. That’s called gender dysphoria, and when it’s not addressed, it’s associated with higher-than-average rates of mental health conditions and suicide. That said, receiving support and appropriate medical care can mitigate these risks, which suggests that the problem isn’t being trans—it’s someone not being able to live out their gender identity. So there’s no “one size fits all” way to transition. For some people, gender-affirming care simply means talking to a therapist as they navigate transitioning in social, non-medical ways. Trans people have always been around, and always will be. What’s changing is how familiar people are with various gender identities and terms, how governments are collecting data about trans folks, and how easily people can connect to others with similar identities. That said, in the U.S., we haven’t exactly arrived at the peak of empathy and celebrating diverse gender identities. In 2023 alone, U.S. state legislators proposed—and sometimes passed—over five hundred anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ laws. But the more accurate information is out there, the easier it is to base laws and policies on science and the lived experiences of trans people. And of course, honoring someone's gender identity by using the name and pronouns they choose makes a real difference, too. That word “transition” might sound like a moment [snaps] when somebody becomes who they are. But transitioning looks different for everyone. It can be messy, awkward, and meandering. Just like gender is for a lot of us. Because how people experience sex and gender is way more dynamic than a couple of boxes. Next time, we’ll talk about sexual orientation—or why we like who we like. See you then.

before puberty, a trans kid s transition is primarily social, including things like their name, their pronouns, and their style. however, as puberty approaches, some trans kids might be prescribed a different kind of hormone therapy medication, called puberty blockers  medications that pause the changes that don t align with their gender identity   things like facial hair, breast development, or a deeper voice. puberty blockers have been tested and used safely for decades. and their effects are temporary as soon as someone stops taking them, puberty revs up again. finally, for some people, transitioning can involve surgery to their face or body, to create more masculine or feminine features that better align with their gender identity. you might hear this called  top  or  bottom  surgery, when it involves operating on someone s chest or genitals. these surgeries have been done on people of all genders safely for decades   like how a cisgender woman might get breast reconstruction surgery after a mastectomy. and although there s a common myth that trans people often regret getting gender-affirming surgery, research has shown that it s very rare. all of these interventions fall under a holistic healthcare approach called gender-affirming care, which helps folks align their outward traits with their inner identity. in the vast majority of cases, gender-affirming care is safe, and it s backed by decades of research and by almost every major medical organization in the u.s., including the american medical association and the american psychological association. gender-affirming care can also be life-saving, since it can help with the distress many trans and nonbinary people feel over the mismatch between their actual gender and their assigned one. that s called gender dysphoria, and when it s not addressed, it s associated with higher-than-average rates of mental health conditions and suicide. that said, receiving support and appropriate medical care can mitigate these risks, which suggests that the problem isn t being trans it s someone not being able to live out their gender identity. so there s no  one size fits all  way to transition. for some people, gender-affirming care simply means talking to a therapist as they navigate transitioning in social, non-medical ways. trans people have always been around, and always will be. what s changing is how familiar people are with various gender identities and terms, how governments are collecting data about trans folks, and how easily people can connect to others with similar identities. that said, in the u.s., we haven t exactly arrived at the peak of empathy and celebrating diverse gender identities. in 2023 alone, u.s. state legislators proposed and sometimes passed over five hundred anti-trans and anti-lgbtq  laws. but the more accurate information is out there, the easier it is to base laws and policies on science and the lived experiences of trans people. and of course, honoring someone's gender identity by using the name and pronouns they choose makes a real difference, too. that word  transition  might sound like a moment  snaps  when somebody becomes who they are. but transitioning looks different for everyone. it can be messy, awkward, and meandering. just like gender is for a lot of us. because how people experience sex and gender is way more dynamic than a couple of boxes. next time, we ll talk about sexual orientation or why we like who we like. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was produced in partnership with the kinsey institute at indiana university. if you are interested in learning more, visit their website for resources that explore the topics we discussed in the video today. thank you for watching this episode, which was filmed at our studio in indianapolis and was made with the help of all these very nice people. if you want to help keep crash course free for everyone, forever, you can join our community on patreon.",11754,2047

Personally I don’t have one, but this question—and others like it—have put penises in the spotlight since… well, before spotlights were even invented. Ancient civilizations idolized them. Early Christians hid them. Calvin Klein ads flaunt them. But when you turn a body part into a symbol, you risk missing out on some pretty crucial information. So what’s the real deal with penises? Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] Imagine you’re at a massive parade. We’re talking floats, marching bands. And at the end of the procession is the part we’ve all been waiting for: the arrival of a giant, golden penis? This was the vibe of festivals in ancient Greece that honored the wine god Dionysus. Greeks across the Athens-metropolitan-area celebrated this symbol of fertility with a one-night-only hookup extravaganza. And they weren’t the only ones to celebrate penises. The ancient Egyptians carved their gods with larger-than-life erections to represent creation. And the ancient Romans believed a phallus could ward off the “evil eye,” so they put them on all sorts of things. Kinda like me and Frank’s RedHot sauce. But when Christianity took hold over much of the world, the vibe changed, and it became more common to see the penis as a symbol of evil and sin. In the 1560s, the Council of Trent launched a campaign to cover up penises with fig leaves. And many women who were accused of witchcraft were actually accused of penis-stealing, or having “knowledge of the devil’s penis.” Hate em or love em, the theme was the same: Penises were a big deal. And to some degree, I totally get it. I think penises are fascinating! Like, it can just get erect without you telling it to. If you have a penis, you might’ve had your first erection before you were born, and you could have your last after you die. You don’t see that happen in zombie movies. But if we just think of penises as a symbol of celebration or sin, we’re missing out on learning about actual penises, which are pretty amazing. Just not in the parade float kinda way. Unlike the vulva and vagina, we’ve known how penises work for a long time. At least, once we got past the idea that erect penises were just full of air. Early thinkers were pretty fascinated by the D, including Leonardo da Vinci. Near the end of the 15th century, he dissected human cadavers and drew elaborate sketches of the penis structure, becoming the first to note that erections are not caused by air, but by increased blood flow to the penis. And since da Vinci’s day, our knowledge of the penis has… kept on growing. So let’s get into it. While the vulva has different holes for peeing and sex, the penis has just one small hole at the end of it. It’s called the meatus (nope, I am not joking), and it’s the exit for both urine and semen—the fluid that comes out when a person ejaculates. While pee has a relatively straight shot from the bladder out of the body, semen takes… more of a scenic route. After being formed in the testicles, mature sperm travels from a duct called the epididymis through a crazy-straw looking tube called the vas deferens, and eventually into another tube called the urethra, before it’s shot out from the meatus during ejaculation. And if the penis pulling double-duty makes you think, “Uh, Shan, doesn’t that mean I might pee during sex?” Don’t worry. During arousal, the muscles in the internal urethral sphincter contract, presumably to keep that very thing from happening. Now, as for semen — you might assume it’s mostly made of sperm, but sperm is only two to five percent of total semen volume. The rest is its entourage of nutrients and carrier liquid that keep the sperm alive and wriggling, and help defend them against the natural acidity of the vagina. For a full anatomy lesson, you can check out Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology. But even if you can label a penis diagram with your eyes closed, there’s more to it than just the bits and bobs. So, let’s grab some questions from the Intimate Inbox. Oh here’s a good one… “Why do I get an erection while I’m sleeping?” Right, so, the penis is mostly made of a specialized kind of tissue with tons of tiny blood vessels in it. When blood flow increases, the penis swells, just like how a sponge swells when it's full of water. And while this increase in blood flow can happen when you’re aroused, it can also happen for seemingly no reason at all, including when you’re asleep. Overnight, your body regulates itself and its blood flow. Other than that, researchers still don’t fully understand why erections happen during sleep — or how often. Alright, let’s see if I have another one here… “Is it possible to break my penis? I’m SO SCARED of breaking my penis.” Well, I have some great news for you. Even though we use the word “boner” to refer to an erect penis, the human penis doesn’t actually have any bones. That said, if a penis is forcefully bent while it’s erect, the spongy tissue can rupture and tear, which can cause lots of pain and needs immediate medical attention. This is called a penis fracture, but I can’t stress enough that this is not a common outcome of sex or masturbation, so it’s not something to lose sleep, or pleasure, over. Okay, here’s a question from a non-penis-haver. “When I don’t want to have sex after making out, my boyfriend says he has blue balls. What does that mean?” I’m so glad you asked this question. The penis isn’t the only organ that can swell during arousal. Blood flow to the entire genital area is increased, including to the testicles, to help move semen to the urethra. So if someone gets aroused but doesn’t ejaculate, it can cause a temporary buildup of blood in the testicles, which can feel uncomfortable. Fun fact: the same thing goes for the clitoris! But unless that erection lasts for more than four hours, which actually is a sign of a medical condition, “blue balls” aren’t in any way dangerous. Ejaculating or just waiting for the arousal to subside will bring relief. And if your partner has blue balls, that isn’t something you have to help them with. Ok. [Shan rustling papers] Well, it looks like all the other questions in here are all just the same question: “Is my penis normal?” And the short answer to that is… probably? I mean, I’m not a doctor. But probably! If it ever feels like people make a huge deal out of penis size, you’re right. In general, Western societies have tended to associate bigger penises with masculinity, fertility, wealth, confidence — all sorts of things that have nothing to do with the actual size of someone’s genitals, but can do a great job at making someone feel insecure about themselves. Again with the useless symbolism! So let’s cut to the chase. The best estimates we have for average penis size come from a 2023 paper that analyzed seventy-five studies and included over fifty-five thousand measurements from different populations around the world. These were the results: an average flaccid length of 3.4 inches and an average erect length of 5.5 inches. As for girth, or circumference, another large study found an average flaccid girth of 3.7 inches, and an average erect girth of 4.6 inches. Before you whip out the measuring tape, here’s the thing: an average is just an average. There’s a significant range on either side of that middle number that’s considered “normal.” Plus, research shows that folks with penises are the ones who assign size the most importance. One study showed that eight-five percent of women were satisfied with the size of their partner’s penis, while only fifty-five percent of men were happy with what they had goin’ on. And in most cases, penis size is pretty unrelated to sexual performance. Outside of size, there’s a lot of variation to penises. Most are darker than the rest of the body and have one tone on the shaft and one tone on the head. Some have visible veins, and some penises are straight while others have a slight curve to them—up, down or to either side. And then there’s circumcision. You may have heard the words “cut” and “uncut” used to describe circumcised and uncircumcised penises. That’s because circumcision, typically performed at birth, is a surgery that removes the layer of skin covering the end of the penis, called the foreskin. Folks have been performing circumcisions since ancient times, and it’s arguably still the most common surgery performed today. Circumcision is chosen for all sorts of reasons, often as part of cultural or religious traditions. And it’s become the norm in some places, like the U.S. While it’s definitely not the norm in other places, like the UK. It’s hard to say exactly why this is, but it could’ve become cemented in the U.S. healthcare system and culture over time, possibly as a holdover from puritanical attitudes toward sex. Puritans used to see circumcision as a cure for masturbation, which they considered unhealthy and sinful. And you might be thinking, “But Shan, isn’t circumcision more hygienic?” Well, the jury’s out on that one. Most healthcare experts agree that there are some minimal benefits and some minimal risks associated with circumcision—not enough to firmly recommend either way. In either case, hygiene is a must. The best way to clean your penis is to pull back the foreskin all the way—if there is any—and wash thoroughly but gently with your fingers and warm water. You can also use a gentle, unscented soap. So there you have it. Penises might have been the stuff of legend for much of human history, but take away all the symbolism, and it turns out they’re just a really cool part of the human body. This is just the start of our foray into penises. We’ll be talking more about them—and other sex organs—in future episodes. Speaking of, next time, we’ll talk about what it means to transition.

These are just a few of the questions I hear every day as a sex educator. The vulva and the vagina can feel like they’re shrouded in mystery. So let’s change that! Because from the superstar clitoris to the billions of microorganisms hanging out in vaginas, there’s a whole lot of amazing stuff going on down there. Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] You know how when someone makes a penis joke, it’s usually lighthearted and funny, but then you go talking about vulvas and suddenly you’re getting a weird side eye? No? Just me? Here’s what I’m getting at: what’s considered “female anatomy” can be tangled up with shame. Take the word “pudendum.” It’s a medical term for genitals that usually refers to the Vulva & Associates, and it comes from a Latin word that means “to be ashamed.” And that matters. Not just because we’re stigmatizing anatomy that roughly half the population has, but also because studies have shown that people who felt bad about their vulva and vagina were less likely to enjoy sex, or seek medical care when they needed it. This shame has also influenced how much we know about the vagina and co. Most of our modern understanding of sexual anatomy has been shaped by centuries of male-dominated thinking and research—much of which was conducted without the input of women, or anyone who wasn’t a cisgender man. Even a bunch of female organs are named after the male scientists who “discovered” them. Like, Fallopian tubes? Named after Gabriele Falloppio, who famously, didn’t have any. Here’s the deal, labias and genitals: the better we understand how all bodies work, the better off we are. So, let’s get into it. First things first: all this is not the vagina. Everything you can see from the outside is the vulva. The technical term for this area above the vulva is the mons pubis. These two outer lips are the labia majora. Then you have the inner lips—the labia minora—and within them, two holes. This teeny one at the end of the urethra is the urethral opening, which is where urine comes out, and this middle one down here is the vaginal opening, which is the doorway to the vagina. The vagina is that inner canal beyond the vaginal opening… and that’s it. Vulva, external; vagina, internal. When there’s nothing inside a vagina, it’s more of a flat envelope than a gaping tunnel. It’s an average of just over two inches long. But during arousal? It can expand up to eight inches… to make room for whatever it is you’ve got going on. Meanwhile, on the outside, the vulva extends all the way down here. This space of delicate tissue between the vaginal opening and the anus is called the perineum. You can learn more about these parts in Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology. But for now, let me introduce you to this superstar: the clitoris. It’s tucked under the clittoral hood, but don’t let its size fool you. The part that we can see is just the tip of the iceberg. The clitoris is actually a large, complex structure that extends inside the pelvic cavity, and it’s made up of the same kind of spongy erectile tissue as the penis. Its full structure wasn’t uncovered until 2005—and this time, by a woman: Australian urologist Helen O’Connell. Keep in mind, the penis was fully anatomically described as early as 35 BCE, so the clitoris has been waiting a long time for the spotlight. The clitoris has over 10,000 nerve endings, and one of its main purposes is sexual pleasure, hence the superstar status. We’ll talk more about it in future episodes. But for now, let’s answer some questions from the Intimate Inbox. I’ll do the honors. Alright, the first question… “My vulva doesn’t look like the one on the poster in my health class. Is there something wrong with it?” You know what? Most people’s vulvas do not look like that. The inner lips can be longer than the outer lips. Both sets of labia can be different sizes or lengths. Your pubic hair can be bushy , wispy, curly, or straight. Your clitoris might be smaller or larger, and all of this diversity—as long as you’re not in pain or something’s affecting your quality of life—is normal. You might trim, shave, or wax your pubic hair for personal comfort or for intimacy, or you might not! There’s no right way to landscape your lawn, if you know what I’m saying. Alright, here’s another one. “Why is my skin down there darker than the rest of me?” That’s totally normal, too! Everyone’s skin has melanin in it, the pigment that gives skin its color. Around your genitals, these pigment-producing cells are super sensitive to hormones, and our hormones are really active in these areas. When the two interact, they create more pigment. Simple as that. “What’s with all the wetness?” You might have heard that when someone with a vulva gets aroused, they get “wet.” And that’s true! During sexual arousal more blood flows to the genital area. That makes these two little glands here and these two little glands here release fluid to lubricate the vaginal opening. Think of it as a natural lube. Fluid decreases friction, and just generally makes it easier for things to slide in and out of the vagina. But listen, vaginas get wet for all sorts of reasons. One of the most common ones? The big D: discharge. If you’ve ever looked in your underwear and been like, “Uhhhhh, what is that?” it’s probably discharge, which is the vagina’s wash cycle. The vagina cleans itself by shedding old cells, and it keeps the tissue healthy and protected with moisture. Vaginas produce around a half to a full teaspoon of discharge every day, but the fluid and the amount of it varies from person to person and throughout the menstrual cycle. Some of that discharge is from the glands we talked about earlier, but some is also produced by the cervix: where the vagina ends and the uterus begins. Really, though, the only time you should worry about discharge is if it’s different from your normal — like if it’s green-ish or foamy, has blood in it when it’s not your period, or smells off. In those cases, do consider talking to your doctor. “Sometimes my discharge smells…not bad, but kinda funky. Why is that?” Great question! To find out, let’s take a trip… inside the vagina. Believe it or not, everyone’s genitals are covered in microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. But don’t panic— that’s actually a good thing! The vagina is home to its own magnificent world of microorganisms, mostly bacteria, and they’re an essential part of keeping things safe and healthy. This invisible community is called the vaginal microbiome. Now, the research into all of this is pretty new, so there’s still a lot that we don’t know. And many studies have largely focused on white, Western women, though new research shows that the makeup of the vaginal microbiome varies by ethnicity. But here’s what we do know: The typical vaginal microbiome is mostly made up of a kind of bacteria called Lactobacillus. It’s the same genus of bacteria that’s found in yogurt and cheese, but it’s not the exact same species. These bacteria produce lactic acid, which keeps the vaginal environment on the acidic end of things. Now, if you’ve ever noticed that the crotch of your underwear wears out fast and gets bleached, that’s because of the lactic acid. The vagina is usually between a 3.8 and a 5 on the pH scale, which puts it somewhere between the acidity of wine vinegar and cucumbers. This keeps yeast and other kinds of local bacteria in check. Okay, back to the smell question. Everyone, especially people with vaginas, face a lot of social pressure to look and smell a certain way. How stuff smells down there depends on what’s going on with the vaginal microbiome, which is heavily affected by hormones. Both semen and menstrual blood can also throw off the vagina’s pH, because they’re more basic. Meaning “the opposite of acidic,” not like, pumpkin spice latte basic. That said, if things smell fishy down there? That could be a sign that the microbiome is out of balance. But here’s the great news: While vulvas benefit from a nice wash with warm water, vaginas are self-cleaning. You never need to use soap or any other kind of cleaning product inside your vagina. It’s cliterally bad for you, because your pH can be thrown off if you disturb it too much. And, when the microbiome is out of whack, that can lead to inflammation, discomfort, and pain. Overall, just like with discharge, the only time you should worry about how your vagina smells is if it’s different from your normal. Vulvas, vaginas, and everything that goes with them are pretty amazing. And they’re worth talking about and studying so that we can understand them just like any other part of the human body. And when it comes to what’s normal? If you have a vulva, the most important thing is learning what’s normal for you, to keep your body healthy, safe, and feelin’ in flow. Next time, we’re turning the spotlight on penises. See you then. This episode of Crash Course Sex Ed was produced in partnership with the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.
