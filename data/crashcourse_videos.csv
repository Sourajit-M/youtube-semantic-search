t6xLo1XYZZs,How is AI impacting society?: Crash Course Futures of AI #2,"AI is taking over…or is it? And what would that look like anyway? The smarter it gets, the better AI will become at doing– basically everything. That could lead us to a bright future, with booming economies and tons of free time for us human beings. But it could also lead us to something a lot darker. In order to prepare for that transition, we have to try and understand what it would really look like.

UFJQV5Jb0pY,The History of AI Explained: Crash Course Futures of AI #1,"In 1965, Moore’s Law predicted how computers would become smaller, faster, and more powerful than ever before. But here in 2025, we’re on the brink of an even bigger revolution. In this episode, we explore where AI's been, what it can do, and where it might be going. AI benchmarks and scaling laws help us understand what AI is, and could be, capable of. 

Introduction 00:00
How did AI get here? 2:21
How do we measure AI progress? 7:47
How can we predict the future of AI? 9:10
Conclusion 11:29

About This Series:
AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on copyright infringement, misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

P.S. Wondering if we used AI to create this series? Nope! Every Complexly video is lovingly, painstakingly human-made.

c7wCbbmLtiI,The Secret Language of Cults: Crash Course Lecture,"Words hold tremendous power. Cult leaders know that all too well — but so do fitness instructors, celebrities, and corporate leaders. In our world today, we are increasingly exposed to, and influenced by, complicated mazes of buzzwords, mantras, euphemisms, clichés, and redefinitions: in short, language that’s just a little bit cultish. Social commentator and author Amanda Montell presents this Crash Course lecture about linguistics, culture, and belonging. 

What’s a Crash Course Lecture?
While traditional Crash Courses on our channel break open an entire school subject, a Crash Course lecture tackles a single topic in-depth. Each lecture shares the perspective of a scholar, journalist, or thinker.

Introduction: A Story of Words 00:00
Cult-ish 1:22
Children of Synanon 3:33
The Cultish Past 7:22
The Cultish Present 12:55

Under the Illusion 32:19
Exit Strategy 37:14
The Prestige 41:11
