t6xLo1XYZZs,How is AI impacting society?: Crash Course Futures of AI #2,"AI is taking over…or is it? And what would that look like anyway? The smarter it gets, the better AI will become at doing– basically everything. That could lead us to a bright future, with booming economies and tons of free time for us human beings. But it could also lead us to something a lot darker. In order to prepare for that transition, we have to try and understand what it would really look like.

To help us understand exactly how it To help us understand exactly how it could transform our world, some could transform our world, some could transform our world, some researchers like to break down AI into researchers like to break down AI into researchers like to break down AI into levels. The first level is narrowly levels. The first level is narrowly levels. The first level is narrowly transformative AI. This is the kind of transformative AI. This is the kind of transformative AI. This is the kind of technology that could lead to technology that could lead to technology that could lead to practically irreversible change, but practically irreversible change, but practically irreversible change, but only in a specific area like the only in a specific area like the only in a specific area like the spinning jenny did for textiles. But spinning jenny did for textiles. But spinning jenny did for textiles. But some AI models have the potential to some AI models have the potential to some AI models have the potential to change all the most important aspects of change all the most important aspects of change all the most important aspects of our society. We call that second level our society. We call that second level our society. We call that second level transformative AI and it's on par with transformative AI and it's on par with transformative AI and it's on par with inventions like electricity and the inventions like electricity and the inventions like electricity and the internal combustion engine which you internal combustion engine which you internal combustion engine which you know transformed our entire world. And know transformed our entire world. And know transformed our entire world. And then there's another third level, a then there's another third level, a then there's another third level, a theoretical level that we're building up theoretical level that we're building up theoretical level that we're building up to that could make even bigger changes, to that could make even bigger changes, to that could make even bigger changes, ones we can't exactly imagine yet. ones we can't exactly imagine yet. ones we can't exactly imagine yet. radically transformative AI could impact radically transformative AI could impact radically transformative AI could impact not just our day-to-day lives, but how not just our day-to-day lives, but how not just our day-to-day lives, but how we measure progress, find worth, and we measure progress, find worth, and we measure progress, find worth, and think about our place in the world. Most think about our place in the world. Most think about our place in the world. Most people think AI with human level people think AI with human level people think AI with human level intelligence, known as artificial intelligence, known as artificial intelligence, known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, would be general intelligence, or AGI, would be general intelligence, or AGI, would be radically transformative. It's hard to radically transformative. It's hard to radically transformative. It's hard to predict when AGI will hit the streets or predict when AGI will hit the streets or predict when AGI will hit the streets or the cloud. Some people think we're the cloud. Some people think we're the cloud. Some people think we're really close, like a year or two away, really close, like a year or two away, really close, like a year or two away, but some others put that number closer but some others put that number closer but some others put that number closer to the year 2030 or even 2050. A small to the year 2030 or even 2050. A small to the year 2030 or even 2050. A small subset of people think we're centuries subset of people think we're centuries subset of people think we're centuries away from AGI, if we achieve it ever. away from AGI, if we achieve it ever. away from AGI, if we achieve it ever. But even without AGI, we're already in But even without AGI, we're already in But even without AGI, we're already in for some pretty big world restructuring. for some pretty big world restructuring. for some pretty big world restructuring. One really clear way we're seeing AI One really clear way we're seeing AI One really clear way we're seeing AI restructure our world already is in the restructure our world already is in the restructure our world already is in the economy. [music] And to help us economy. [music] And to help us economy. [music] And to help us understand exactly how, the industrial understand exactly how, the industrial understand exactly how, the industrial revolution is probably [music] the most revolution is probably [music] the most revolution is probably [music] the most helpful example. See, the industrial helpful example. See, the industrial helpful example. See, the industrial revolution saw a lot of manual labor revolution saw a lot of manual labor revolution saw a lot of manual labor become automated, done by fast, accurate become automated, done by fast, accurate become automated, done by fast, accurate machines like the spinning jenny, machines like the spinning jenny, machines like the spinning jenny, instead of slow, fallible humans like instead of slow, fallible humans like instead of slow, fallible humans like me. And automation turned out to be me. And automation turned out to be me. And automation turned out to be really good for the economy, mainly really good for the economy, mainly really good for the economy, mainly because it increased production, [music] because it increased production, [music] because it increased production, [music] or the amount of stuff that could be or the amount of stuff that could be or the amount of stuff that could be made. That's because normally economies made. That's because normally economies made. That's because normally economies are limited by the amount of labor or are limited by the amount of labor or are limited by the amount of labor or workers they have available. But the workers they have available. But the workers they have available. But the spinning jenny and other industrial spinning jenny and other industrial spinning jenny and other industrial revolution era technologies helped revolution era technologies helped revolution era technologies helped industries scoot around that bottleneck industries scoot around that bottleneck industries scoot around that bottleneck and the era's economy absolutely and the era's economy absolutely and the era's economy absolutely exploded. These days, thanks to [music] exploded. These days, thanks to [music] exploded. These days, thanks to [music] AI, machines don't just spin thread. AI, machines don't just spin thread. AI, machines don't just spin thread. They can design the clothes it gets made They can design the clothes it gets made They can design the clothes it gets made into, manage inventory at the store that into, manage inventory at the store that into, manage inventory at the store that sells them, run the algorithm that sells them, run the algorithm that sells them, run the algorithm that recommends them to you, and handle recommends them to you, and handle recommends them to you, and handle returns and exchanges when you call returns and exchanges when you call returns and exchanges when you call customer service. And it doesn't end customer service. And it doesn't end customer service. And it doesn't end with the textile industry. This is with the textile industry. This is with the textile industry. This is happening across tons of different happening across tons of different happening across tons of different markets. And just [music] like all those markets. And just [music] like all those markets. And just [music] like all those centuries ago, that automation could be centuries ago, that automation could be centuries ago, that automation could be really good for our economy. Consider really good for our economy. Consider really good for our economy. Consider this. Our gross world product, the final this. Our gross world product, the final this. Our gross world product, the final market value of all the stuff created in market value of all the stuff created in market value of all the stuff created in the world's economy in a given year, the world's economy in a given year, the world's economy in a given year, usually grows by around two to 5% a usually grows by around two to 5% a usually grows by around two to 5% a year. But if AI keeps advancing the way year. But if AI keeps advancing the way year. But if AI keeps advancing the way it has been, some people predict that it has been, some people predict that it has been, some people predict that [music] by 2100, our gross world product [music] by 2100, our gross world product [music] by 2100, our gross world product could be growing not by 5% [music] could be growing not by 5% [music] could be growing not by 5% [music] but by as much as 30% every year. It's but by as much as 30% every year. It's but by as much as 30% every year. It's kind of unimaginable. And even though kind of unimaginable. And even though kind of unimaginable. And even though many economists [music] are skeptical of many economists [music] are skeptical of many economists [music] are skeptical of this number, it's safe to say that this this number, it's safe to say that this this number, it's safe to say that this could potentially mean really big things could potentially mean really big things could potentially mean really big things for the economy. But just like back for the economy. But just like back for the economy. But just like back then, there's a dirty soot blackened then, there's a dirty soot blackened then, there's a dirty soot blackened flip [music] side to the automation flip [music] side to the automation flip [music] side to the automation coin. What's good for the economy coin. What's good for the economy coin. What's good for the economy overall isn't always good for individual overall isn't always good for individual overall isn't always good for individual workers. The more jobs that get taken workers. The more jobs that get taken workers. The more jobs that get taken over by automation, the more human over by automation, the more human over by automation, the more human employees are pushed out of work. employees are pushed out of work. employees are pushed out of work. [music] And that could change a lot more [music] And that could change a lot more [music] And that could change a lot more than how long it takes us to spin eight than how long it takes us to spin eight than how long it takes us to spin eight threads. Narrowly transformative AI is threads. Narrowly transformative AI is threads. Narrowly transformative AI is already changing the workforce. Since already changing the workforce. Since already changing the workforce. Since the 2000s, automation has taken over the 2000s, automation has taken over the 2000s, automation has taken over something like 1.7 million jobs from something like 1.7 million jobs from something like 1.7 million jobs from customer service to data entry to customer service to data entry to customer service to data entry to manufacturing to writing and editing. manufacturing to writing and editing. manufacturing to writing and editing. But not here on Crash Course. Don't But not here on Crash Course. Don't But not here on Crash Course. Don't worry, humans. And if AGI were to enter worry, humans. And if AGI were to enter worry, humans. And if AGI were to enter the chat, even more jobs or even entire the chat, even more jobs or even entire the chat, even more jobs or even entire professions would be cooked. AGI isn't professions would be cooked. AGI isn't professions would be cooked. AGI isn't here yet, but theoretically it would be here yet, but theoretically it would be here yet, but theoretically it would be able to do anything human cognition can. able to do anything human cognition can. able to do anything human cognition can. And it might even be able to do that And it might even be able to do that And it might even be able to do that work better than we can, transforming work better than we can, transforming work better than we can, transforming not only the economy, but all of human not only the economy, but all of human not only the economy, but all of human society in a way we're not ready for society in a way we're not ready for society in a way we're not ready for yet. But let's see it wear a top hat as yet. But let's see it wear a top hat as yet. But let's see it wear a top hat as well as I can. Like AGI could take over well as I can. Like AGI could take over well as I can. Like AGI could take over the entire workforce, restricting humans the entire workforce, restricting humans the entire workforce, restricting humans to narrow positions like AI oversight, to narrow positions like AI oversight, to narrow positions like AI oversight, which could be few and far between. And which could be few and far between. And which could be few and far between. And that's not even mentioning the that's not even mentioning the that's not even mentioning the environmental impacts of AGI. Even environmental impacts of AGI. Even environmental impacts of AGI. Even today's AI uses huge quantities of today's AI uses huge quantities of today's AI uses huge quantities of energy and water and pumps out huge energy and water and pumps out huge energy and water and pumps out huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Recent quantities of greenhouse gases. Recent quantities of greenhouse gases. Recent data suggests that the average AI data data suggests that the average AI data data suggests that the average AI data center consumes anywhere [music] from center consumes anywhere [music] from center consumes anywhere [music] from 500,000 to several million gallons of 500,000 to several million gallons of 500,000 to several million gallons of water every day. And if AGI becomes water every day. And if AGI becomes water every day. And if AGI becomes ubiquitous, that number will probably ubiquitous, that number will probably ubiquitous, that number will probably skyrocket. All of which is going to skyrocket. All of which is going to skyrocket. All of which is going to exacerbate the pretty gnarly climate exacerbate the pretty gnarly climate exacerbate the pretty gnarly climate change we're already seeing, impacting change we're already seeing, impacting change we're already seeing, impacting not just [music] the natural world, but not just [music] the natural world, but not just [music] the natural world, but our human communities, too. If the our human communities, too. If the our human communities, too. If the radical transformation happens slowly radical transformation happens slowly radical transformation happens slowly enough, and [music] governments start enough, and [music] governments start enough, and [music] governments start planning for it, like now, we might have planning for it, like now, we might have planning for it, like now, we might have time to make it work, governments could time to make it work, governments could time to make it work, governments could introduce environmental standards that introduce environmental standards that introduce environmental standards that require energy usage to be transparent require energy usage to be transparent require energy usage to be transparent and [music] push companies towards and [music] push companies towards and [music] push companies towards greener data centers. They're not greener data centers. They're not greener data centers. They're not currently where I sit in the US in 2025, currently where I sit in the US in 2025, currently where I sit in the US in 2025, but theoretically they could be. but theoretically they could be. but theoretically they could be. Governments could adopt structures like Governments could adopt structures like Governments could adopt structures like job guarantees that would keep us from job guarantees that would keep us from job guarantees that would keep us from being swapped out by AI. Or they could being swapped out by AI. Or they could being swapped out by AI. Or they could take things even further and adopt take things even further and adopt take things even further and adopt universal basic income to make sure universal basic income to make sure universal basic income to make sure people still have money even if our people still have money even if our people still have money even if our labor is replaced by machines. Or labor is replaced by machines. Or labor is replaced by machines. Or implement dividend schemes where humans implement dividend schemes where humans implement dividend schemes where humans would get small payouts from the profits would get small payouts from the profits would get small payouts from the profits AI makes. And that could be really AI makes. And that could be really AI makes. And that could be really transformative if AI takes humanity's transformative if AI takes humanity's transformative if AI takes humanity's place as the beast of burden for our place as the beast of burden for our place as the beast of burden for our economy. There's kind of no telling what economy. There's kind of no telling what economy. There's kind of no telling what we'd get up to. It could totally realign we'd get up to. It could totally realign we'd get up to. It could totally realign our values, our social structures, and our values, our social structures, and our values, our social structures, and and the ways we spend our time. It could and the ways we spend our time. It could and the ways we spend our time. It could change us from cogs in the capitalist change us from cogs in the capitalist change us from cogs in the capitalist machine into maybe something else. I machine into maybe something else. I machine into maybe something else. I might finally have time to catch them might finally have time to catch them might finally have time to catch them all. all. all. I'm at one. But if the transition I'm at one. But if the transition I'm at one. But if the transition happens too fast, without the proper happens too fast, without the proper happens too fast, without the proper safety nets, AGI could leave the safety nets, AGI could leave the safety nets, AGI could leave the majority of humanity unemployed, broke, majority of humanity unemployed, broke, majority of humanity unemployed, broke, and well, chat, cooked. Even if robots and well, chat, cooked. Even if robots and well, chat, cooked. Even if robots don't take over the whole workforce, don't take over the whole workforce, don't take over the whole workforce, these advances in AI could spell these advances in AI could spell these advances in AI could spell disaster for lots of regular people. One disaster for lots of regular people. One disaster for lots of regular people. One way this could happen is that the first way this could happen is that the first way this could happen is that the first people to develop AGI could get really people to develop AGI could get really people to develop AGI could get really powerful really fast. That could mean a powerful really fast. That could mean a powerful really fast. That could mean a single company starts to amass tons and single company starts to amass tons and single company starts to amass tons and tons of wealth, making the wealth tons of wealth, making the wealth tons of wealth, making the wealth inequality of 2025 look like chump inequality of 2025 look like chump inequality of 2025 look like chump change. And think about it on a change. And think about it on a change. And think about it on a governmental level. What if a single governmental level. What if a single governmental level. What if a single government could gain huge political, government could gain huge political, government could gain huge political, economic, and military advantages over economic, and military advantages over economic, and military advantages over all the other ones? The prospect of that all the other ones? The prospect of that all the other ones? The prospect of that huge advantage could lead to an AI arms huge advantage could lead to an AI arms huge advantage could lead to an AI arms race where countries, corporations, and race where countries, corporations, and race where countries, corporations, and maybe even extremist organizations maybe even extremist organizations maybe even extremist organizations hustle to build that super powerful AGI hustle to build that super powerful AGI hustle to build that super powerful AGI model first. All that stuff could be model first. All that stuff could be model first. All that stuff could be pretty bad news for most of humanity. It pretty bad news for most of humanity. It pretty bad news for most of humanity. It could concentrate wealth and influence could concentrate wealth and influence could concentrate wealth and influence in the hands of big companies like in the hands of big companies like in the hands of big companies like Microsoft or Google, billionaires like Microsoft or Google, billionaires like Microsoft or Google, billionaires like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, or greedy Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, or greedy Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, or greedy governments who don't always have the governments who don't always have the governments who don't always have the people's best interest in mind. It could people's best interest in mind. It could people's best interest in mind. It could be used to support authoritarianism be used to support authoritarianism be used to support authoritarianism around the globe. And I'm gonna level around the globe.

Deep fakes are images, videos, starting. Deep fakes are images, videos, starting. Deep fakes are images, videos, or audio recordings that can make it or audio recordings that can make it or audio recordings that can make it look like people are saying or doing look like people are saying or doing look like people are saying or doing things they didn't really say or do. things they didn't really say or do. things they didn't really say or do. They work like lots of other AI does, They work like lots of other AI does, They work like lots of other AI does, where neural networks train on tons and where neural networks train on tons and where neural networks train on tons and tons of data until they can start to tons of data until they can start to tons of data until they can start to generate new data that looks a lot like generate new data that looks a lot like generate new data that looks a lot like it.

And they can get pretty good at And they can get pretty good at And they can get pretty good at imitating people, like say US imitating people, like say US imitating people, like say US presidential candidates. In July of presidential candidates. In July of presidential candidates. In July of 2024, Musk himself shared a campaign 2024, Musk himself shared a campaign 2024, Musk himself shared a campaign video from Democratic candidate Kala video from Democratic candidate Kala video from Democratic candidate Kala Harris where she called herself a deep Harris where she called herself a deep Harris where she called herself a deep state puppet who's hiding her total state puppet who's hiding her total state puppet who's hiding her total incompetence. only Harris never said incompetence. only Harris never said incompetence. only Harris never said that. The video was a deep fake made by that. The video was a deep fake made by that. The video was a deep fake made by AI models trained on Harris's face and AI models trained on Harris's face and AI models trained on Harris's face and voice. And it was viewed over 100 voice. And it was viewed over 100 voice. And it was viewed over 100 million times. Deep fakes are an example million times. Deep fakes are an example million times. Deep fakes are an example of how AI can be used to influence of how AI can be used to influence of how AI can be used to influence voters, spread disinformation, and throw voters, spread disinformation, and throw voters, spread disinformation, and throw elections to those willing to play elections to those willing to play elections to those willing to play dirty. And it's not just political dirty. And it's not just political dirty. And it's not just political parties who are using AI to influence parties who are using AI to influence parties who are using AI to influence politics, but foreign nations, too. Lots politics, but foreign nations, too. Lots politics, but foreign nations, too. Lots of the deep fake content from the 2024 of the deep fake content from the 2024 of the deep fake content from the 2024 US election seems to have come from US election seems to have come from US election seems to have come from Russia, a country that might have some Russia, a country that might have some Russia, a country that might have some reasons to mess with the US's democracy. reasons to mess with the US's democracy. reasons to mess with the US's democracy. Deep fakes's actual impacts on voters Deep fakes's actual impacts on voters Deep fakes's actual impacts on voters aren't totally clear yet, but there aren't totally clear yet, but there aren't totally clear yet, but there [music] is evidence that they've already [music] is evidence that they've already [music] is evidence that they've already influenced voter behavior, not only in influenced voter behavior, not only in influenced voter behavior, not only in the US, but also in countries like the US, but also in countries like the US, but also in countries like Slovakia, Indonesia, and India. And Slovakia, Indonesia, and India. And Slovakia, Indonesia, and India. And things could only get worse as deep things could only get worse as deep things could only get worse as deep fakes get more advanced, manipulating fakes get more advanced, manipulating fakes get more advanced, manipulating voters with disinformation, generating voters with disinformation, generating voters with disinformation, generating doubts around legitimate election doubts around legitimate election doubts around legitimate election results or convincing people not to vote results or convincing people not to vote results or convincing people not to vote at all. Messing with elections like that at all. Messing with elections like that at all. Messing with elections like that is a direct threat to democracy. And if is a direct threat to democracy. And if is a direct threat to democracy. And if AI can help people do it, then it could AI can help people do it, then it could AI can help people do it, then it could easily become a tool of easily become a tool of easily become a tool of authoritarianism, a pretty powerful one. authoritarianism, a pretty powerful one. authoritarianism, a pretty powerful one. And the more AI gets implemented in And the more AI gets implemented in And the more AI gets implemented in things like politics and economics, the things like politics and economics, the things like politics and economics, the more power it'll have in those systems, more power it'll have in those systems, more power it'll have in those systems, and the more it will be able to enforce and the more it will be able to enforce and the more it will be able to enforce the values of those potentially pretty the values of those potentially pretty the values of those potentially pretty evil groups who leverage it. This evil groups who leverage it. This evil groups who leverage it. This hypothetical situation is known as value hypothetical situation is known as value hypothetical situation is known as value lockin and it could leave us stuck with lockin and it could leave us stuck with lockin and it could leave us stuck with systems that are inequitable, systems that are inequitable, systems that are inequitable, anti-democratic, and a threat to human anti-democratic, and a threat to human anti-democratic, and a threat to human rights all supported by AI. So that all rights all supported by AI. So that all rights all supported by AI. So that all sounds scary, but it also kind of sounds sounds scary, but it also kind of sounds sounds scary, but it also kind of sounds like science fiction. While things like like science fiction.

Like Kovville journalist Dena Helio Whitaker said in journalist Dena Helio Whitaker said in journalist Dena Helio Whitaker said in an interview, it's not just about your an interview, it's not just about your an interview, it's not just about your right to claim or to reconnect to that right to claim or to reconnect to that right to claim or to reconnect to that tribal identity. It's about what your tribal identity. It's about what your tribal identity. It's about what your responsibilities are to it. Ultimately, responsibilities are to it.

But it's still harmful for a heritage. But it's still harmful for a heritage. But it's still harmful for a lot of reasons. For one, it separates lot of reasons. For one, it separates lot of reasons. For one, it separates the object from its specific cultural the object from its specific cultural the object from its specific cultural meaning. Like we talked about earlier, meaning. Like we talked about earlier, meaning. Like we talked about earlier, for many tribes, war bonnets are a for many tribes, war bonnets are a for many tribes, war bonnets are a symbol of honor. So wearing one to a symbol of honor. So wearing one to a symbol of honor. So wearing one to a music festival disrespects that cultural music festival disrespects that cultural music festival disrespects that cultural tradition. Also, just like the Hollywood tradition. Also, just like the Hollywood tradition. Also, just like the Hollywood westerns that collapse hundreds of westerns that collapse hundreds of westerns that collapse hundreds of distinct cultures into one stereotype, distinct cultures into one stereotype, distinct cultures into one stereotype, dressing up as Native American makes a dressing up as Native American makes a dressing up as Native American makes a caricature out of real living people.

In fact, believing that Native Americans fact, believing that Native Americans fact, believing that Native Americans are a relic of the past can make are a relic of the past can make are a relic of the past can make non-natives think that those costumes non-natives think that those costumes non-natives think that those costumes aren't offensive. Hi again. Yep, still aren't offensive. Hi again. Yep, still aren't offensive. Hi again. Yep, still here. And not only are we still here, here. And not only are we still here, here. And not only are we still here, but the legacies of colonialism are but the legacies of colonialism are but the legacies of colonialism are still ongoing in our communities. As still ongoing in our communities. As still ongoing in our communities. As Cherokee writer and scholar Adrien Keane Cherokee writer and scholar Adrien Keane Cherokee writer and scholar Adrien Keane points out, dawning a headdress means points out, dawning a headdress means points out, dawning a headdress means contributing to the culture of power contributing to the culture of power contributing to the culture of power that continues to cycle today. Cultural that continues to cycle today. Cultural that continues to cycle today. Cultural appropriation can also apply to native appropriation can also apply to native appropriation can also apply to native inspired items such as dream catchers inspired items such as dream catchers inspired items such as dream catchers and jewelry. I get it. Our designs are and jewelry. I get it. Our designs are and jewelry. I get it. Our designs are dope. But when non-native folks profit dope. But when non-native folks profit dope. But when non-native folks profit off of those designs, it's not a good off of those designs, it's not a good off of those designs, it's not a good look. In fact, in some cases, it's look. In fact, in some cases, it's look. In fact, in some cases, it's illegal. Since 1990, the Indian Arts and illegal. Since 1990, the Indian Arts and illegal.

Trust me, those do you any good. Trust me, those do you any good. Trust me, those nightmares know a real one when they see nightmares know a real one when they see nightmares know a real one when they see one. Pretendianism and cultural one. Pretendianism and cultural one. Pretendianism and cultural appropriation can be messy and native appropriation can be messy and native appropriation can be messy and native folks don't always agree on where folks don't always agree on where folks don't always agree on where exactly the lines fall, which makes exactly the lines fall, which makes exactly the lines fall, which makes sense because contrary to the old sense because contrary to the old sense because contrary to the old cowboys and Indian stereotype, we're not cowboys and Indian stereotype, we're not cowboys and Indian stereotype, we're not all the same.

UFJQV5Jb0pY,The History of AI Explained: Crash Course Futures of AI #1,"In 1965, Moore’s Law predicted how computers would become smaller, faster, and more powerful than ever before. But here in 2025, we’re on the brink of an even bigger revolution. In this episode, we explore where AI's been, what it can do, and where it might be going. AI benchmarks and scaling laws help us understand what AI is, and could be, capable of. 

Introduction 00:00
How did AI get here? 2:21
How do we measure AI progress? 7:47
How can we predict the future of AI? 9:10
Conclusion 11:29

About This Series:
AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on copyright infringement, misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

P.S. Wondering if we used AI to create this series? Nope! Every Complexly video is lovingly, painstakingly human-made.

0Y3ekwHfq5g,Crash Course Preview: What Are the Possible Futures of AI?,"Welcome to Crash Course: Futures of AI! Our host Kousha Navidar is here to guide you through the ins and outs of our potential AI futures. 

AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on copyright infringement, misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

P.S. Wondering if we used AI to create this series? Nope! Every Complexly video is lovingly, painstakingly human-made.

Um, and in this particular be about. Um, and in this particular be about. Um, and in this particular conversation, we were talking about a conversation, we were talking about a conversation, we were talking about a new exhibit at our local science museum new exhibit at our local science museum new exhibit at our local science museum that was focused on um, spittlebugs. that was focused on um, spittlebugs. that was focused on um, spittlebugs. This bug that you see here in the This bug that you see here in the This bug that you see here in the picture, uh, they like surround picture, uh, they like surround picture, uh, they like surround themselves with this spit-like casing. themselves with this spit-like casing. themselves with this spit-like casing. And I was just telling the host all And I was just telling the host all And I was just telling the host all about the different scientific reasons about the different scientific reasons about the different scientific reasons behind this. And uh there was this like behind this. And uh there was this like behind this. And uh there was this like really this moment I always remember really this moment I always remember really this moment I always remember where um my boss interrupted me and she where um my boss interrupted me and she where um my boss interrupted me and she goes, ""Wow, you love science."" And I was goes, ""Wow, you love science."" And I was goes, ""Wow, you love science."" And I was like, ""What? I don't No, I don't. I I like, ""What? I don't No, I don't. I I like, ""What? I don't No, I don't. I I had never thought about myself as a had never thought about myself as a had never thought about myself as a person who loved science. You know, from person who loved science. You know, from person who loved science. You know, from a young age, I felt like I was sort of a young age, I felt like I was sort of a young age, I felt like I was sort of an English social studies type person."" an English social studies type person."" an English social studies type person."" And uh I it was a moment and but she was And uh I it was a moment and but she was And uh I it was a moment and but she was like, ""No, listen to the enthusiasm in like, ""No, listen to the enthusiasm in like, ""No, listen to the enthusiasm in your voice. You love science."" And it your voice. You love science."" And it your voice. You love science."" And it was just a moment that really opened my was just a moment that really opened my was just a moment that really opened my eyes and made me think about how much eyes and made me think about how much eyes and made me think about how much further science can resonate when it's further science can resonate when it's further science can resonate when it's focused on stories and the excitement of focused on stories and the excitement of focused on stories and the excitement of discovery. And that was a big discovery. And that was a big discovery. And that was a big influential moment that I I think about influential moment that I I think about influential moment that I I think about all the time now doing what we do here all the time now doing what we do here all the time now doing what we do here at Crash Course. Uh, and now I'll let at Crash Course. Uh, and now I'll let at Crash Course.

So, I got to working at Crash Course. So, I got to sort of use a lot of my different skills sort of use a lot of my different skills sort of use a lot of my different skills and niche interests um in this job and and niche interests um in this job and and niche interests um in this job and I've worked on a bunch of shows um under I've worked on a bunch of shows um under I've worked on a bunch of shows um under the illustrious guidance of Megan. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you both. Um so, yeah, if &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you both. Um so, yeah, if you I'm going to ask I'm going to ask a you I'm going to ask I'm going to ask a you I'm going to ask I'm going to ask a question for the chat first, but then I question for the chat first, but then I question for the chat first, but then I would love it if you both could tell us would love it if you both could tell us would love it if you both could tell us how a crash course script gets made. And how a crash course script gets made. And how a crash course script gets made. And for all of you watching at home, thank for all of you watching at home, thank for all of you watching at home, thank you for telling me where you're from. you for telling me where you're from. you for telling me where you're from. Massachusetts girly. Go birds. Um, Massachusetts girly. Go birds. Um, Massachusetts girly. Go birds. Um, how many people do you think the average how many people do you think the average how many people do you think the average crash course script goes through before crash course script goes through before crash course script goes through before production? We tend to talk about steps production? We tend to talk about steps production? We tend to talk about steps and there's pre-production, production, and there's pre-production, production, and there's pre-production, production, when it's filmed, and post-production. when it's filmed, and post-production. when it's filmed, and post-production. So, but within each of those steps, So, but within each of those steps, So, but within each of those steps, there's a lot going on. So, if you have there's a lot going on. So, if you have there's a lot going on. So, if you have any guesses about how many people you any guesses about how many people you any guesses about how many people you think the average Crash Grow script think the average Crash Grow script think the average Crash Grow script touches before it goes to be filmed with touches before it goes to be filmed with touches before it goes to be filmed with the host, go ahead and make your guesses the host, go ahead and make your guesses the host, go ahead and make your guesses in the chat and Megan and Annie will in the chat and Megan and Annie will in the chat and Megan and Annie will teach us that along the way. Awesome. So, I'm going to talk a little Awesome. So, I'm going to talk a little bit about what makes a crash course bit about what makes a crash course bit about what makes a crash course script. Um, you know, what exactly is script. Um, you know, what exactly is script. Um, you know, what exactly is the special sauce of of a crash course the special sauce of of a crash course the special sauce of of a crash course script? And, um, the first thing is that script? And, um, the first thing is that script? And, um, the first thing is that it needs to be accurate. Um, anytime it needs to be accurate. Um, anytime it needs to be accurate. Um, anytime you're making educational materials or you're making educational materials or you're making educational materials or tools, that's the bottom line is that we tools, that's the bottom line is that we tools, that's the bottom line is that we have to be as accurate as possible. So, have to be as accurate as possible. So, have to be as accurate as possible. So, the crash course scripts go through lots the crash course scripts go through lots the crash course scripts go through lots of people to make sure that our scripts of people to make sure that our scripts of people to make sure that our scripts are as accurate as possible. We use um are as accurate as possible. We use um are as accurate as possible. We use um primary sources and peer-reviewed primary sources and peer-reviewed primary sources and peer-reviewed research. We have fact checkers, experts research. We have fact checkers, experts research. We have fact checkers, experts in the field. Um, and we also share our in the field. Um, and we also share our in the field. Um, and we also share our sources for each of the videos in the sources for each of the videos in the sources for each of the videos in the description to make sure we're as description to make sure we're as description to make sure we're as transparent as possible. Um, so that's transparent as possible. Um, so that's transparent as possible. Um, so that's like the main thing, but then also you like the main thing, but then also you like the main thing, but then also you might know that like we have a crown might know that like we have a crown might know that like we have a crown coursey tone and um that comes from coursey tone and um that comes from coursey tone and um that comes from trying to be clear, engaging, and trying to be clear, engaging, and trying to be clear, engaging, and inclusive. So we try to make our videos inclusive. So we try to make our videos inclusive. So we try to make our videos as accessible as possible and not use as accessible as possible and not use as accessible as possible and not use too much jargon, you know, define terms too much jargon, you know, define terms too much jargon, you know, define terms when we have them. Um, but make sure when we have them. Um, but make sure when we have them. Um, but make sure it's like simple language that feels it's like simple language that feels it's like simple language that feels everyday and conversational and that is everyday and conversational and that is everyday and conversational and that is engaging in the way a conversation with engaging in the way a conversation with engaging in the way a conversation with a friend would be. We like to learn a friend would be. We like to learn a friend would be. We like to learn alongside the viewer rather than simply alongside the viewer rather than simply alongside the viewer rather than simply teach. Um, and our videos also answer teach. Um, and our videos also answer teach. Um, and our videos also answer the so what. So, we talk about a lot in the so what. So, we talk about a lot in the so what. So, we talk about a lot in editorial spaces, which is we're editorial spaces, which is we're editorial spaces, which is we're learning something, but why does it learning something, but why does it learning something, but why does it matter? Why should the viewer care that matter? Why should the viewer care that matter? Why should the viewer care that u we're learning this information? And u we're learning this information? And u we're learning this information? And that really guides and propels both the that really guides and propels both the that really guides and propels both the series and each individual script. series and each individual script. series and each individual script. Um, and we also build around narrative. Um, and we also build around narrative. Um, and we also build around narrative. Um, storytelling is really essential to Um, storytelling is really essential to Um, storytelling is really essential to Crash Course and it helps us remember Crash Course and it helps us remember Crash Course and it helps us remember the things we learn and put them into the things we learn and put them into the things we learn and put them into context with our daily lives. So, we'll context with our daily lives. So, we'll context with our daily lives. So, we'll talk much more about narrative in a talk much more about narrative in a talk much more about narrative in a second, but um, our next um, quality is second, but um, our next um, quality is second, but um, our next um, quality is that all our scripts are entirely that all our scripts are entirely that all our scripts are entirely original. We do not use AI in any of our original. We do not use AI in any of our original. We do not use AI in any of our creative work. Um, and we make sure creative work. Um, and we make sure creative work. Um, and we make sure everything is crystal clear, not everything is crystal clear, not everything is crystal clear, not plagiarized. Um any script you hear plagiarized. Um any script you hear plagiarized. Um any script you hear recited by the host has been um made by recited by the host has been um made by recited by the host has been um made by humans which we really pride ourselves humans which we really pride ourselves humans which we really pride ourselves in. Um and our scripts also treat our in. Um and our scripts also treat our in. Um and our scripts also treat our audience with honesty, nuance and care. audience with honesty, nuance and care. audience with honesty, nuance and care. We want to really imagine that our We want to really imagine that our We want to really imagine that our audience are the complex people that audience are the complex people that audience are the complex people that they are and try to showcase stories um they are and try to showcase stories um they are and try to showcase stories um and also like hypothetical scenarios and also like hypothetical scenarios and also like hypothetical scenarios that feel like they represent a wide that feel like they represent a wide that feel like they represent a wide variety of people. And so how does this all start? Um once And so how does this all start? Um once we have a series green lit, the first we have a series green lit, the first we have a series green lit, the first step is to sort of envision what the step is to sort of envision what the step is to sort of envision what the series might look like. And so that series might look like. And so that series might look like. And so that starts with a brainstormed episode list. starts with a brainstormed episode list. starts with a brainstormed episode list. We often enlist the help of a subject We often enlist the help of a subject We often enlist the help of a subject matter expert who can help us figure out matter expert who can help us figure out matter expert who can help us figure out what do we want all the episodes to be what do we want all the episodes to be what do we want all the episodes to be about? Um how do we want to convey the about? Um how do we want to convey the about? Um how do we want to convey the information? What are some possible information? What are some possible information? What are some possible hooks and stories that we could use to hooks and stories that we could use to hooks and stories that we could use to express that information? And so this express that information? And so this express that information? And so this takes a bit of iteration trying to takes a bit of iteration trying to takes a bit of iteration trying to figure out, you know, how many episodes figure out, you know, how many episodes figure out, you know, how many episodes makes the most sense, what do we want to makes the most sense, what do we want to makes the most sense, what do we want to talk about in each one and sort of a lot talk about in each one and sort of a lot talk about in each one and sort of a lot of brainstorming happens at this stage. of brainstorming happens at this stage. of brainstorming happens at this stage. And after that, we create a syllabus. So And after that, we create a syllabus. So And after that, we create a syllabus. So if you've ever taken a college class, if you've ever taken a college class, if you've ever taken a college class, you know, the first day of class, your you know, the first day of class, your you know, the first day of class, your professor shows up and hands you a piece professor shows up and hands you a piece professor shows up and hands you a piece of paper that details what the whole of paper that details what the whole of paper that details what the whole course is going to cover. And that's course is going to cover. And that's course is going to cover. And that's what we use as sort of an internal guide what we use as sort of an internal guide what we use as sort of an internal guide for um our for our our videos um and to for um our for our our videos um and to for um our for our our videos um and to help our writers uh script their uh help our writers uh script their uh help our writers uh script their uh videos. So the syllabus is basically a videos. So the syllabus is basically a videos. So the syllabus is basically a really fleshed out episode list. We have really fleshed out episode list. We have really fleshed out episode list. We have things like the course description, the things like the course description, the things like the course description, the learning objectives, and then we break learning objectives, and then we break learning objectives, and then we break down each script um topic into subtopics down each script um topic into subtopics down each script um topic into subtopics and put in all of the actual concrete and put in all of the actual concrete and put in all of the actual concrete information that we want to convey. So, information that we want to convey. So, information that we want to convey. So, we'll have things like key terms, but we'll have things like key terms, but we'll have things like key terms, but also fun stuff like special segments or also fun stuff like special segments or also fun stuff like special segments or also misconceptions we want to make sure also misconceptions we want to make sure also misconceptions we want to make sure that we address or don't fall into. Um, that we address or don't fall into. Um, that we address or don't fall into. Um, and then that is sort of the framework and then that is sort of the framework and then that is sort of the framework that the writer uses to create their that the writer uses to create their that the writer uses to create their first draft. first draft. first draft. And so that takes a lot of research on And so that takes a lot of research on And so that takes a lot of research on their part, looking through all of the their part, looking through all of the their part, looking through all of the uh sources that are linked in the uh sources that are linked in the uh sources that are linked in the syllabus and figuring out how to build a syllabus and figuring out how to build a syllabus and figuring out how to build a story around that information. And so story around that information. And so story around that information. And so after that it goes through many rounds after that it goes through many rounds after that it goes through many rounds of edits including through me through of edits including through me through of edits including through me through Megan and eventually after going through Megan and eventually after going through Megan and eventually after going through a fact checker and a producer and the a fact checker and a producer and the a fact checker and a producer and the host it becomes a real actual video. Um host it becomes a real actual video. Um host it becomes a real actual video. Um shout out to Latin American literature shout out to Latin American literature shout out to Latin American literature which is airing now. which is airing now. which is airing now. Okay so here's the answer to the Okay so here's the answer to the Okay so here's the answer to the question. A it does range, but somewhere question. A it does range, but somewhere question. A it does range, but somewhere around 8 to 10 plus people work on every around 8 to 10 plus people work on every around 8 to 10 plus people work on every crash course script. And that's just the crash course script. And that's just the crash course script. And that's just the script. You should more than double it script. You should more than double it script. You should more than double it once you start to get into the video once you start to get into the video once you start to get into the video elements and the animation elements. elements and the animation elements. elements and the animation elements. Sometimes we have uh you know Sometimes we have uh you know Sometimes we have uh you know illustrator like for Native American illustrator like for Native American illustrator like for Native American history, we have illustrators who are history, we have illustrators who are history, we have illustrators who are from indigenous cultures and things like from indigenous cultures and things like from indigenous cultures and things like that. And then that um that adds more that. And then that um that adds more that. And then that um that adds more and more collaborators which is is and more collaborators which is is and more collaborators which is is something that uh is so fun and and something that uh is so fun and and something that uh is so fun and and rewarding for us and we hope it is for rewarding for us and we hope it is for rewarding for us and we hope it is for the audience as well. Um so I'm going to the audience as well. Um so I'm going to the audience as well. Um so I'm going to show you I know you can't see this. Uh show you I know you can't see this. Uh show you I know you can't see this. Uh and I kind of wanted to show it to you and I kind of wanted to show it to you and I kind of wanted to show it to you this way just to emphasize like it this way just to emphasize like it this way just to emphasize like it doesn't fit on a slide. The crash course doesn't fit on a slide. The crash course doesn't fit on a slide. The crash course script process is so elaborate it script process is so elaborate it script process is so elaborate it doesn't really fit on a slide. But I am doesn't really fit on a slide. But I am doesn't really fit on a slide. But I am going to sort of um zoom in for you and going to sort of um zoom in for you and going to sort of um zoom in for you and show you a a high level of our full sort show you a a high level of our full sort show you a a high level of our full sort of flowchart of how a crash course of flowchart of how a crash course of flowchart of how a crash course script gets made. Um so I'm going to try script gets made. Um so I'm going to try script gets made. Um so I'm going to try to zoom in. Um basically we start once to zoom in. Um basically we start once to zoom in. Um basically we start once yeah like Annie said once we decide to yeah like Annie said once we decide to yeah like Annie said once we decide to make a series the first thing we do is make a series the first thing we do is make a series the first thing we do is we hire a subject matter expert. That's we hire a subject matter expert. That's we hire a subject matter expert. That's going to take a few months. Then we move going to take a few months. Then we move going to take a few months. Then we move into a sort of curriculum development into a sort of curriculum development into a sort of curriculum development phase. So, we're taking several weeks to phase. So, we're taking several weeks to phase. So, we're taking several weeks to develop an episode list, like a develop an episode list, like a develop an episode list, like a highlevel outline, like she talked highlevel outline, like she talked highlevel outline, like she talked about. Then, we're taking several more about. Then, we're taking several more about. Then, we're taking several more weeks to fill out that outline with weeks to fill out that outline with weeks to fill out that outline with sources, with story ideas, etc. If we sources, with story ideas, etc. If we sources, with story ideas, etc. If we have a funding partner, of course, have a funding partner, of course, have a funding partner, of course, there's back and forth during that part. there's back and forth during that part. there's back and forth during that part. Um, finally, once the syllabus is Um, finally, once the syllabus is Um, finally, once the syllabus is complete, we move into scripting. And I complete, we move into scripting. And I complete, we move into scripting. And I don't expect you I'm just sort of taking don't expect you I'm just sort of taking don't expect you I'm just sort of taking you through this just to give you a you through this just to give you a you through this just to give you a sense of the scope. Obviously, there's sense of the scope. Obviously, there's sense of the scope. Obviously, there's not going to be a pop quiz at the end. not going to be a pop quiz at the end. not going to be a pop quiz at the end. Um but yeah, then we move into a first Um but yeah, then we move into a first Um but yeah, then we move into a first draft. We have our subject matter expert draft. We have our subject matter expert draft. We have our subject matter expert review every single draft to make sure review every single draft to make sure review every single draft to make sure that we've gotten everything right at a that we've gotten everything right at a that we've gotten everything right at a high level. We have uh multiple edits. high level. We have uh multiple edits. high level. We have uh multiple edits. So first we have like a developmental So first we have like a developmental So first we have like a developmental edit which is more focused on story and edit which is more focused on story and edit which is more focused on story and priorities. You know, did we spend priorities. You know, did we spend priorities. You know, did we spend enough time on one thing and too much enough time on one thing and too much enough time on one thing and too much time on another thing? Things like that. time on another thing? Things like that. time on another thing? Things like that. Then we have the the lead editor do a Then we have the the lead editor do a Then we have the the lead editor do a second edit. Um and then uh things get second edit. Um and then uh things get second edit. Um and then uh things get passed to different types of passed to different types of passed to different types of stakeholders. The script gets passed to stakeholders. The script gets passed to stakeholders. The script gets passed to different types of stakeholders. So, we different types of stakeholders. So, we different types of stakeholders. So, we send the script to our producers and our send the script to our producers and our send the script to our producers and our producers are really focused on like producers are really focused on like producers are really focused on like like I always tell this story that one like I always tell this story that one like I always tell this story that one time um in our religion series, we had time um in our religion series, we had time um in our religion series, we had an introduction that was about uh a an introduction that was about uh a an introduction that was about uh a small community who experienced what small community who experienced what small community who experienced what felt to this community at this church felt to this community at this church felt to this community at this church like to be a miracle. And it was that like to be a miracle. And it was that like to be a miracle. And it was that there was a painting on their church and there was a painting on their church and there was a painting on their church and it it like started dripping oil and they it it like started dripping oil and they it it like started dripping oil and they were like, ""This is a miracle, a modern were like, ""This is a miracle, a modern were like, ""This is a miracle, a modern miracle."" Um, and I was like, ""Oh, this miracle."" Um, and I was like, ""Oh, this miracle."" Um, and I was like, ""Oh, this is such an exciting place to start the is such an exciting place to start the is such an exciting place to start the script."" And the producer was like, script."" And the producer was like, script."" And the producer was like, ""Okay, but what are they going to see on ""Okay, but what are they going to see on ""Okay, but what are they going to see on screen? It's lit. It's a wall. You want screen? It's lit. It's a wall. You want screen? It's lit. It's a wall. You want you want people to look at a wall, just you want people to look at a wall, just you want people to look at a wall, just a blank a wall. It it's it's as it's a blank a wall. It it's it's as it's a blank a wall. It it's it's as it's almost paint drying. That's what you're almost paint drying. That's what you're almost paint drying. That's what you're asking for."" So, [laughter] asking for."" So, [laughter] asking for."" So, [laughter] the producers bring a really different the producers bring a really different the producers bring a really different perspective than what we might be perspective than what we might be perspective than what we might be thinking about on the editorial side, thinking about on the editorial side, thinking about on the editorial side, and that's really helpful. We also have and that's really helpful. We also have and that's really helpful. We also have our host review the scripts and change our host review the scripts and change our host review the scripts and change up little jokes and references to make up little jokes and references to make up little jokes and references to make it more personal to them. And then fact it more personal to them. And then fact it more personal to them. And then fact check, copy edit. So that's when we go check, copy edit. So that's when we go check, copy edit. So that's when we go back through to make sure um you know back through to make sure um you know back through to make sure um you know just polish everything, make sure we're just polish everything, make sure we're just polish everything, make sure we're not being too redundant, make sure not being too redundant, make sure not being too redundant, make sure everything feels sensitive. And then everything feels sensitive. And then everything feels sensitive. And then finally we get to the table read which finally we get to the table read which finally we get to the table read which is a sort of a rehearsal with our host. is a sort of a rehearsal with our host. is a sort of a rehearsal with our host. But I will move off of this annoying and But I will move off of this annoying and But I will move off of this annoying and difficult to look at Figma board. um and difficult to look at Figma board. um and difficult to look at Figma board. um and move back to our deck if I can. Let's move back to our deck if I can. Let's move back to our deck if I can. Let's see. see. see. &gt;&gt; Cool. And I feel like now is a great &gt;&gt; Cool. And I feel like now is a great &gt;&gt; Cool. And I feel like now is a great time while you while you do that, Megan, time while you while you do that, Megan, time while you while you do that, Megan, looking at all those people on all those looking at all those people on all those looking at all those people on all those stages. stages. stages. &gt;&gt; Um I just want to thank Crash Course is &gt;&gt; Um I just want to thank Crash Course is &gt;&gt; Um I just want to thank Crash Course is free.

Um, so me? I just lost one headphone. Um, so moving forward, Annie, you had mentioned moving forward, Annie, you had mentioned moving forward, Annie, you had mentioned that we're going to talk more about that we're going to talk more about that we're going to talk more about narrative. Um, and so let's go ahead and narrative. Um, and so let's go ahead and narrative. Um, and so let's go ahead and talk that. How do you take this talk that. How do you take this talk that. How do you take this commitment to accuracy, all this commitment to accuracy, all this commitment to accuracy, all this research that you're doing, and then research that you're doing, and then research that you're doing, and then turn it into a compelling story that turn it into a compelling story that turn it into a compelling story that people are going to not only be people are going to not only be people are going to not only be interested in watching, but also that interested in watching, but also that interested in watching, but also that will help stay in their minds? And um I will help stay in their minds? And um I will help stay in their minds? And um I just before I actually pass it over to just before I actually pass it over to just before I actually pass it over to you, uh some questions that came up that you, uh some questions that came up that you, uh some questions that came up that are related to that is do you follow are related to that is do you follow are related to that is do you follow like a certain kind of style guide um like a certain kind of style guide um like a certain kind of style guide um and how does that interact with with and how does that interact with with and how does that interact with with that process? Yeah, we have our own that process? Yeah, we have our own that process? Yeah, we have our own style guide that we sort of adhere to, style guide that we sort of adhere to, style guide that we sort of adhere to, but it's also sort of in flux. We don't but it's also sort of in flux. We don't but it's also sort of in flux. We don't necessarily we're not strictly AP or necessarily we're not strictly AP or necessarily we're not strictly AP or Chicago or anything like that. Also, Chicago or anything like that. Also, Chicago or anything like that. Also, because the information is imparted because the information is imparted because the information is imparted verbally, so you can't really see the verbally, so you can't really see the verbally, so you can't really see the text anyway, but we do have a style text anyway, but we do have a style text anyway, but we do have a style guide that helps us keep things in order guide that helps us keep things in order guide that helps us keep things in order um on our end. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Uh so yeah, big big picture we &gt;&gt; Awesome. Uh so yeah, big big picture we something we really think about when something we really think about when something we really think about when we're trying to figure out how to make we're trying to figure out how to make we're trying to figure out how to make it all a story. Uh we ask ourselves the it all a story. Uh we ask ourselves the it all a story. Uh we ask ourselves the these three questions. What am I these three questions. What am I these three questions. What am I learning that I didn't know before? learning that I didn't know before? learning that I didn't know before? What's making me feel something? And What's making me feel something? And What's making me feel something? And what's my genuine journey of discovery? what's my genuine journey of discovery? what's my genuine journey of discovery? Um almost all of the time our writers Um almost all of the time our writers Um almost all of the time our writers are not experts on the subject. And so are not experts on the subject. And so are not experts on the subject. And so when we give them this these syllabi, when we give them this these syllabi, when we give them this these syllabi, they are genuinely reading information, they are genuinely reading information, they are genuinely reading information, digesting things, synthesizing digesting things, synthesizing digesting things, synthesizing information for the first time, learning information for the first time, learning information for the first time, learning a lot of things for the first time. And a lot of things for the first time. And a lot of things for the first time. And that means that we get frustrated that means that we get frustrated that means that we get frustrated sometimes. We get confused. We're sometimes. We get confused. We're sometimes. We get confused. We're grasping for like analogies and grasping for like analogies and grasping for like analogies and metaphors to try to latch on to metaphors to try to latch on to metaphors to try to latch on to something we already know. And then something we already know. And then something we already know. And then sometimes those fall apart and we have sometimes those fall apart and we have sometimes those fall apart and we have to start again. that whole process of to start again. that whole process of to start again. that whole process of learning um it happens to us and every learning um it happens to us and every learning um it happens to us and every time we try to write a crash course time we try to write a crash course time we try to write a crash course script and you know when you grow up script and you know when you grow up script and you know when you grow up when you go to school you learn to hide when you go to school you learn to hide when you go to school you learn to hide that whole part of the writing process that whole part of the writing process that whole part of the writing process and just document okay I've sorted it and just document okay I've sorted it and just document okay I've sorted it out and let me put the clean and out and let me put the clean and out and let me put the clean and finished part on the page but what we finished part on the page but what we finished part on the page but what we try to do is really hold on to what were try to do is really hold on to what were try to do is really hold on to what were the highs and lows of my journey to the highs and lows of my journey to the highs and lows of my journey to understanding this information what were understanding this information what were understanding this information what were the twists and turns the moments where I the twists and turns the moments where I the twists and turns the moments where I fell into a misconception or got fell into a misconception or got fell into a misconception or got confused and how did I sort of resolve confused and how did I sort of resolve confused and how did I sort of resolve that and we try to build a story from that and we try to build a story from that and we try to build a story from that. that. that. Um, and I I think this is like an Um, and I I think this is like an Um, and I I think this is like an extremely nerdy thing to say, but I I extremely nerdy thing to say, but I I extremely nerdy thing to say, but I I think I can prove it to you. um that it think I can prove it to you. um that it think I can prove it to you. um that it it seems crazy to say that we would we it seems crazy to say that we would we it seems crazy to say that we would we take our journey of discovery and make take our journey of discovery and make take our journey of discovery and make it like a plot, but um I'm going to show it like a plot, but um I'm going to show it like a plot, but um I'm going to show you how we you can really layer a crash you how we you can really layer a crash you how we you can really layer a crash course script onto this is like a common course script onto this is like a common course script onto this is like a common plot structure. I pulled this from the plot structure. I pulled this from the plot structure. I pulled this from the legendary comedy training center upright legendary comedy training center upright legendary comedy training center upright Citizens Brigade. This is their um this Citizens Brigade. This is their um this Citizens Brigade. This is their um this is like an adapted version of their plot is like an adapted version of their plot is like an adapted version of their plot structure for like a TV show pilot, like structure for like a TV show pilot, like structure for like a TV show pilot, like a comedy TV show pilot. But I'm going to a comedy TV show pilot. But I'm going to a comedy TV show pilot. But I'm going to show you how um a crash course script show you how um a crash course script show you how um a crash course script defining and the nerdy concept of what defining and the nerdy concept of what defining and the nerdy concept of what is a species actually kind of fits into is a species actually kind of fits into is a species actually kind of fits into this TV pilot format. Um so we'll start this TV pilot format. Um so we'll start this TV pilot format. Um so we'll start with fun. Open with something fun, with fun. Open with something fun, with fun. Open with something fun, interesting, and relatable. So this is interesting, and relatable. So this is interesting, and relatable. So this is an example from a real crash course an example from a real crash course an example from a real crash course script. A sleepy bassad hound and a script. A sleepy bassad hound and a script. A sleepy bassad hound and a tireless border collie look and act like tireless border collie look and act like tireless border collie look and act like they're from different planets, but they they're from different planets, but they they're from different planets, but they can have a weird looking litter of can have a weird looking litter of can have a weird looking litter of puppies that can make more puppies. puppies that can make more puppies. puppies that can make more puppies. That's because they're the same species. That's because they're the same species. That's because they're the same species. But meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and But meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and But meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. But known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. But known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. But sadly, that source can't have more Zorse sadly, that source can't have more Zorse sadly, that source can't have more Zorse babies because horses and zebras are babies because horses and zebras are babies because horses and zebras are different species. So okay, organis two different species. So okay, organis two different species. So okay, organis two organisms are considered members of the organisms are considered members of the organisms are considered members of the same species if they can mate and make same species if they can mate and make same species if they can mate and make fertile offspring. fertile offspring. fertile offspring. Okay, but we encounter a frustration Okay, but we encounter a frustration Okay, but we encounter a frustration right off the bat. Life has been known right off the bat. Life has been known right off the bat. Life has been known to break these rules. Like there are to break these rules. Like there are to break these rules. Like there are some hybrids that can reproduce. You some hybrids that can reproduce. You some hybrids that can reproduce. You might know some of them without knowing might know some of them without knowing might know some of them without knowing you know them. Like if you've ever had a you know them. Like if you've ever had a you know them. Like if you've ever had a plumcot from the grocery store, but plumcot from the grocery store, but plumcot from the grocery store, but there are also hybrid animals that can there are also hybrid animals that can there are also hybrid animals that can reproduce, including this hybrid lizard reproduce, including this hybrid lizard reproduce, including this hybrid lizard species. Uh, and females actually don't species. Uh, and females actually don't species. Uh, and females actually don't even need a mate to do so. So, that even need a mate to do so. So, that even need a mate to do so. So, that completely breaks the definition of completely breaks the definition of completely breaks the definition of species that I just gave to you. We've species that I just gave to you. We've species that I just gave to you. We've hit a snag. We've hit our first conflict hit a snag. We've hit our first conflict hit a snag. We've hit our first conflict in our plot. in our plot. in our plot. Okay. Well, then the next the next part Okay. Well, then the next the next part Okay. Well, then the next the next part of the story structure is having a a new of the story structure is having a a new of the story structure is having a a new plan, a false victory. Okay. So, because plan, a false victory. Okay. So, because plan, a false victory. Okay. So, because of exceptions like the plumcot and that of exceptions like the plumcot and that of exceptions like the plumcot and that lizard, uh, other scientists think it's lizard, uh, other scientists think it's lizard, uh, other scientists think it's better to define species by their better to define species by their better to define species by their genealogy. According to this idea, all genealogy. According to this idea, all genealogy. According to this idea, all organisms in the same evolutionary organisms in the same evolutionary organisms in the same evolutionary lineage are one species. lineage are one species. lineage are one species. Oops. But that gets complicated for a Oops. But that gets complicated for a Oops. But that gets complicated for a bunch of reasons, including that there bunch of reasons, including that there bunch of reasons, including that there are literally billions of extinct are literally billions of extinct are literally billions of extinct species that are pretty tough to learn species that are pretty tough to learn species that are pretty tough to learn about and to link with living ones. So, about and to link with living ones. So, about and to link with living ones. So, this concept really isn't perfect this concept really isn't perfect this concept really isn't perfect either. And we really things escalate. either. And we really things escalate. either. And we really things escalate. We fall into chaos with our plot when we We fall into chaos with our plot when we We fall into chaos with our plot when we also consider, okay, here's another way also consider, okay, here's another way also consider, okay, here's another way to think about species. Uh what if we to think about species. Uh what if we to think about species. Uh what if we parse them based on environmental parse them based on environmental parse them based on environmental conditions like how polar bears live in conditions like how polar bears live in conditions like how polar bears live in a different type of habitat than grizzly a different type of habitat than grizzly a different type of habitat than grizzly bears? Well, that starts to fall apart bears? Well, that starts to fall apart bears? Well, that starts to fall apart as soon as you consider any number of as soon as you consider any number of as soon as you consider any number of species that live in more than one species that live in more than one species that live in more than one environment. And at this point, we might environment. And at this point, we might environment. And at this point, we might want to level with our audience. We say, want to level with our audience. We say, want to level with our audience. We say, if all of this feels confusing to you, if all of this feels confusing to you, if all of this feels confusing to you, you're actually on to something. In real you're actually on to something. In real you're actually on to something. In real life, it's really difficult to pin down life, it's really difficult to pin down life, it's really difficult to pin down what makes a species. And every single what makes a species. And every single what makes a species. And every single definition of species that scientists definition of species that scientists definition of species that scientists have come up with is imperfect. have come up with is imperfect. have come up with is imperfect. But we still have to resolve it somehow. But we still have to resolve it somehow. But we still have to resolve it somehow. Uh and ultimately we land on well humans Uh and ultimately we land on well humans Uh and ultimately we land on well humans make knowledge by categorizing things make knowledge by categorizing things make knowledge by categorizing things even if those categories aren't as even if those categories aren't as even if those categories aren't as rockolid as we wish they were. Um so our rockolid as we wish they were. Um so our rockolid as we wish they were. Um so our systems for naming and classifying systems for naming and classifying systems for naming and classifying things are totally imperfect and at the things are totally imperfect and at the things are totally imperfect and at the same time super super useful. Having same time super super useful. Having same time super super useful. Having working death species definitions lets working death species definitions lets working death species definitions lets us compare and contrast things notice us compare and contrast things notice us compare and contrast things notice what they have in common. But it's also what they have in common. But it's also what they have in common. But it's also really really interesting when those really really interesting when those really really interesting when those things break and that helps us learn things break and that helps us learn things break and that helps us learn more about the world and about how more about the world and about how more about the world and about how nature works. Awesome. Thanks Megan. Um and if any Awesome. Thanks Megan. Um and if any questions come up feel free to drop them questions come up feel free to drop them questions come up feel free to drop them in the chat. Um, and yes, that we had in the chat. Um, and yes, that we had in the chat. Um, and yes, that we had talked earlier about the different steps talked earlier about the different steps talked earlier about the different steps and writing, research and writing, and and writing, research and writing, and and writing, research and writing, and now we're getting to editing some of the now we're getting to editing some of the now we're getting to editing some of the invisible work that goes into this. Um, invisible work that goes into this. Um, invisible work that goes into this. Um, and then we had a question from earlier. and then we had a question from earlier. and then we had a question from earlier. I just want to highlight um that came up I just want to highlight um that came up I just want to highlight um that came up from Tass. Thank you, Tass, for asking from Tass. Thank you, Tass, for asking from Tass. Thank you, Tass, for asking this. And as you're telling us more this. And as you're telling us more this. And as you're telling us more about editing, Annie, if you want to about editing, Annie, if you want to about editing, Annie, if you want to tell us, does Crash Course have a tell us, does Crash Course have a tell us, does Crash Course have a plagiarism check used to make sure that plagiarism check used to make sure that plagiarism check used to make sure that someone's not accidentally plagiarizing someone's not accidentally plagiarizing someone's not accidentally plagiarizing or maybe one of your writers is is or maybe one of your writers is is or maybe one of your writers is is plagiarizing? And what is your process plagiarizing? And what is your process plagiarizing? And what is your process for dealing with potential potential for dealing with potential potential for dealing with potential potential plagiarism and the editing process? plagiarism and the editing process? plagiarism and the editing process? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question. Um, &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question. Um, &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question. Um, towards the end of the editing process, towards the end of the editing process, towards the end of the editing process, we run through all of our scripts uh we run through all of our scripts uh we run through all of our scripts uh through Grammarly. They have a great through Grammarly. They have a great through Grammarly. They have a great plagiarism check function um that checks plagiarism check function um that checks plagiarism check function um that checks it alongside many many many pages and it alongside many many many pages and it alongside many many many pages and documents on the internet. Um and documents on the internet. Um and documents on the internet. Um and fortunately we have like a lot of people fortunately we have like a lot of people fortunately we have like a lot of people with good integrity on our team. So I with good integrity on our team. So I with good integrity on our team. So I don't know if we've ever come across don't know if we've ever come across don't know if we've ever come across anything that's been remotely close. anything that's been remotely close. anything that's been remotely close. Sometimes it might be like this sentence Sometimes it might be like this sentence Sometimes it might be like this sentence is really close to this sentence and is really close to this sentence and is really close to this sentence and then it's like a quote. Um, [laughter] then it's like a quote. Um, [laughter] then it's like a quote. Um, [laughter] so sometimes you might need to like so sometimes you might need to like so sometimes you might need to like reward a sentence if it just came too reward a sentence if it just came too reward a sentence if it just came too close to an original source, but the close to an original source, but the close to an original source, but the vast majority of the time there are no vast majority of the time there are no vast majority of the time there are no problems. Um, especially because of how problems. Um, especially because of how problems. Um, especially because of how many edits we go through, it's just so many edits we go through, it's just so many edits we go through, it's just so far from the source by then that far from the source by then that far from the source by then that plagiarism isn't really a concern. But, plagiarism isn't really a concern. But, plagiarism isn't really a concern. But, uh, if there ever were a concern, we uh, if there ever were a concern, we uh, if there ever were a concern, we would probably address it pretty would probably address it pretty would probably address it pretty swiftly. Um, but fortunately, I haven't swiftly. Um, but fortunately, I haven't swiftly. Um, but fortunately, I haven't run into that problem. run into that problem. run into that problem. Um, but yeah, we can get started talking Um, but yeah, we can get started talking Um, but yeah, we can get started talking about editing. So, something we thought about editing. So, something we thought about editing. So, something we thought might be a good idea to talk about today might be a good idea to talk about today might be a good idea to talk about today is specifically editing a crash course is specifically editing a crash course is specifically editing a crash course intro. Um, intros are super important. intro. Um, intros are super important. intro. Um, intros are super important. The first 30 seconds are essential to a The first 30 seconds are essential to a The first 30 seconds are essential to a video. If you're uh you've ever uploaded video. If you're uh you've ever uploaded video. If you're uh you've ever uploaded anything to YouTube, you know about how anything to YouTube, you know about how anything to YouTube, you know about how long it takes for a view to count. And long it takes for a view to count. And long it takes for a view to count. And then also it's what helps us get the then also it's what helps us get the then also it's what helps us get the attention right away, get it engaged, attention right away, get it engaged, attention right away, get it engaged, and then move through and set up the and then move through and set up the and then move through and set up the rest of the video. Um, so yeah, the rest of the video. Um, so yeah, the rest of the video. Um, so yeah, the first 30 seconds are super important. first 30 seconds are super important. first 30 seconds are super important. And we're going to um talk about some of And we're going to um talk about some of And we're going to um talk about some of the common pitfalls that we see when we the common pitfalls that we see when we the common pitfalls that we see when we are editing um crash courseware scripts. So, the first common issue is when an So, the first common issue is when an intro meanders. Um, so you can pull up intro meanders. Um, so you can pull up intro meanders. Um, so you can pull up that intro, Megan. Um, so this is an that intro, Megan. Um, so this is an that intro, Megan. Um, so this is an original intro for a script for Crash original intro for a script for Crash original intro for a script for Crash Course Sexed. And the first thing you Course Sexed. And the first thing you Course Sexed. And the first thing you might notice is that it's pretty long might notice is that it's pretty long might notice is that it's pretty long for 30 seconds. It's kind of a lot of for 30 seconds. It's kind of a lot of for 30 seconds. It's kind of a lot of information. Um, and it's covering a lot information. Um, and it's covering a lot information. Um, and it's covering a lot of great stuff in context, but that's of great stuff in context, but that's of great stuff in context, but that's not usually what the function of the not usually what the function of the not usually what the function of the intro is. We're more trying to grab intro is. We're more trying to grab intro is. We're more trying to grab attention. an intriguing concept or attention. an intriguing concept or attention. an intriguing concept or question. And so a lot of this question. And so a lot of this question. And so a lot of this information is stuff that would better information is stuff that would better information is stuff that would better suit later on in the script. Um, even suit later on in the script. Um, even suit later on in the script. Um, even the fun joke we have at the end about the fun joke we have at the end about the fun joke we have at the end about how to pronounce LGBTQIA, it's not quite how to pronounce LGBTQIA, it's not quite how to pronounce LGBTQIA, it's not quite going to hit in an intro. So we decided going to hit in an intro. So we decided going to hit in an intro. So we decided to take things in a different direction to take things in a different direction to take things in a different direction for our edited version. And so where we for our edited version. And so where we for our edited version. And so where we came to was talking about our host came to was talking about our host came to was talking about our host Sham's first crush. So, first crushes Sham's first crush. So, first crushes Sham's first crush. So, first crushes are a pretty common experience and we're are a pretty common experience and we're are a pretty common experience and we're able to relate to the audience and have able to relate to the audience and have able to relate to the audience and have them reflect on their own experiences by them reflect on their own experiences by them reflect on their own experiences by starting there. And also, it's kind of starting there. And also, it's kind of starting there. And also, it's kind of juicy. Like, it's a little bit gossipy. juicy. Like, it's a little bit gossipy. juicy. Like, it's a little bit gossipy. It's got that fun big sister feel that It's got that fun big sister feel that It's got that fun big sister feel that we were really shooting for with our we were really shooting for with our we were really shooting for with our host for Sex Ed. Um, and so we just sort host for Sex Ed. Um, and so we just sort host for Sex Ed. Um, and so we just sort of connected some barebones ideas and of connected some barebones ideas and of connected some barebones ideas and then allowed Shan to come in and add her then allowed Shan to come in and add her then allowed Shan to come in and add her personal experiences. And that really personal experiences. And that really personal experiences. And that really lightened the tone. it kind of brought lightened the tone. it kind of brought lightened the tone. it kind of brought us into a very complex idea which is us into a very complex idea which is us into a very complex idea which is what is sexuality um by talking about what is sexuality um by talking about what is sexuality um by talking about something really relatable and easy to something really relatable and easy to something really relatable and easy to understand and um added some punchy understand and um added some punchy understand and um added some punchy questions to get us into the rest of the questions to get us into the rest of the questions to get us into the rest of the script. script. script. So the next common issue is burying the So the next common issue is burying the So the next common issue is burying the lead. So obviously when we're we have an lead. So obviously when we're we have an lead. So obviously when we're we have an intro we want to start with a punch and intro we want to start with a punch and intro we want to start with a punch and this story is super interesting from this story is super interesting from this story is super interesting from Native American history. We're talking Native American history. We're talking Native American history. We're talking about a tribe that was arguably very about a tribe that was arguably very about a tribe that was arguably very successful and then something happened. successful and then something happened. successful and then something happened. They got terminated by the federal They got terminated by the federal They got terminated by the federal government and things really went government and things really went government and things really went downhill very quickly for them. Um, so downhill very quickly for them. Um, so downhill very quickly for them. Um, so it's a really interesting story, but it's a really interesting story, but it's a really interesting story, but honestly the most interesting part is honestly the most interesting part is honestly the most interesting part is the sentence right before Chang's the sentence right before Chang's the sentence right before Chang's introduction where he says uh at the introduction where he says uh at the introduction where he says uh at the dawning of the termination era that's dawning of the termination era that's dawning of the termination era that's exactly what makes them a target. So we exactly what makes them a target. So we exactly what makes them a target. So we thought why don't we move some things thought why don't we move some things thought why don't we move some things around to try to make this um more around to try to make this um more around to try to make this um more interesting. So in our final version, we interesting. So in our final version, we interesting. So in our final version, we started with that idea, shifted it to started with that idea, shifted it to started with that idea, shifted it to the top and said things were looking up the top and said things were looking up the top and said things were looking up for the Monomony tribe of Wisconsin and for the Monomony tribe of Wisconsin and for the Monomony tribe of Wisconsin and that's exactly what made them a target. that's exactly what made them a target. that's exactly what made them a target. So immediately we feel a little bit more So immediately we feel a little bit more So immediately we feel a little bit more suspense, a little bit more intrigue suspense, a little bit more intrigue suspense, a little bit more intrigue just by moving one sentence and then we just by moving one sentence and then we just by moving one sentence and then we keep that same context, but now we have keep that same context, but now we have keep that same context, but now we have a reason to be interested and then just a reason to be interested and then just a reason to be interested and then just kind of put a bow on it at the end by kind of put a bow on it at the end by kind of put a bow on it at the end by saying, you know, the Monomony had a saying, you know, the Monomony had a saying, you know, the Monomony had a safety net, but it was about to break. safety net, but it was about to break. safety net, but it was about to break. So, we're able to really build suspense So, we're able to really build suspense So, we're able to really build suspense in um the intro just by shifting a few in um the intro just by shifting a few in um the intro just by shifting a few parts around. Um and our Oh, go ahead, Kayla. Um and our Oh, go ahead, Kayla. &gt;&gt; Um awesome. Just Nope, you keep going. I &gt;&gt; Um awesome. Just Nope, you keep going. I &gt;&gt; Um awesome. Just Nope, you keep going. I will I'll add this one next. I thought I will I'll add this one next. I thought I will I'll add this one next. I thought I thought there was natural pause. You thought there was natural pause. You thought there was natural pause. You keep going. Sorry. Right. keep going. Sorry. Right. keep going. Sorry. Right. &gt;&gt; No worries. Um and uh our last common &gt;&gt; No worries. Um and uh our last common &gt;&gt; No worries. Um and uh our last common issue that we'll talk about today is issue that we'll talk about today is issue that we'll talk about today is when there isn't enough feeling. So, when there isn't enough feeling. So, when there isn't enough feeling. So, intros, part of what makes them grabby intros, part of what makes them grabby intros, part of what makes them grabby is um connecting to human emotion. And is um connecting to human emotion. And is um connecting to human emotion. And so this is from an episode of Crash so this is from an episode of Crash so this is from an episode of Crash Course Religions about cults. And it's Course Religions about cults. And it's Course Religions about cults. And it's fun. It's got a great light-hearted fun. It's got a great light-hearted fun. It's got a great light-hearted tone, a sort of, you know, relatable tone, a sort of, you know, relatable tone, a sort of, you know, relatable concept of what do we think of when we concept of what do we think of when we concept of what do we think of when we think of the word cults. Um, but it's a think of the word cults. Um, but it's a think of the word cults. Um, but it's a little bit generic and it could probably little bit generic and it could probably little bit generic and it could probably pack a little bit more of a punch. So, pack a little bit more of a punch. So, pack a little bit more of a punch. So, we decided to shake things up a little we decided to shake things up a little we decided to shake things up a little bit in our edited version where we sort bit in our edited version where we sort bit in our edited version where we sort of put the viewer themselves into a of put the viewer themselves into a of put the viewer themselves into a scenario. We said, ""Picture this. You're scenario. We said, ""Picture this. You're scenario. We said, ""Picture this. You're in a cozy room surrounded by people in a cozy room surrounded by people in a cozy room surrounded by people welcoming you with good food and welcoming you with good food and welcoming you with good food and kindness. They're showing interest in kindness. They're showing interest in kindness. They're showing interest in your questions, your anxieties, and you your questions, your anxieties, and you your questions, your anxieties, and you hold on a second. Is this a cult? So, it hold on a second. Is this a cult? So, it hold on a second. Is this a cult? So, it sort of, you know, lulls the viewer into sort of, you know, lulls the viewer into sort of, you know, lulls the viewer into a sense of safety and comfort and then a sense of safety and comfort and then a sense of safety and comfort and then disrupts that immediately that sort of disrupts that immediately that sort of disrupts that immediately that sort of counterintuition is something we often counterintuition is something we often counterintuition is something we often use in our episodes. Um, and also it use in our episodes. Um, and also it use in our episodes. Um, and also it tackles that kind of relatable question tackles that kind of relatable question tackles that kind of relatable question that a lot of people ask themselves, that a lot of people ask themselves, that a lot of people ask themselves, which is like, would I fall for a cult? which is like, would I fall for a cult? which is like, would I fall for a cult? It's kind of a an intriguing juicy It's kind of a an intriguing juicy It's kind of a an intriguing juicy question. Um, and then we tacked on a question. Um, and then we tacked on a question. Um, and then we tacked on a bit of a punchier end to that as well by bit of a punchier end to that as well by bit of a punchier end to that as well by saying, can we really tell the saying, can we really tell the saying, can we really tell the difference between a religion and a difference between a religion and a difference between a religion and a cult? So, we sort of tightened things up cult? So, we sort of tightened things up cult? So, we sort of tightened things up and made them a little bit more packing and made them a little bit more packing and made them a little bit more packing a punch. Um, and just heightened it. You a punch. Um, and just heightened it. You a punch. Um, and just heightened it. You know, the original intro was fine and know, the original intro was fine and know, the original intro was fine and great, but we were able to make it even great, but we were able to make it even great, but we were able to make it even better. And so, you know, these are just better. And so, you know, these are just better. And so, you know, these are just intros, but we apply a lot of these same intros, but we apply a lot of these same intros, but we apply a lot of these same tactics to the rest of the script as tactics to the rest of the script as tactics to the rest of the script as well to make things engaging by adding well to make things engaging by adding well to make things engaging by adding hypothetical scenarios and jokes and hypothetical scenarios and jokes and hypothetical scenarios and jokes and personal reflections from the host. All personal reflections from the host. All personal reflections from the host. All these things can kind of tie together these things can kind of tie together these things can kind of tie together the whole episode. Um, but the intro is the whole episode. Um, but the intro is the whole episode. Um, but the intro is where that sort of shines right at the where that sort of shines right at the where that sort of shines right at the start. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And then a &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And then a question that came up um that was sort question that came up um that was sort question that came up um that was sort of timely when talking about sexed is of timely when talking about sexed is of timely when talking about sexed is from Rachel and from Rachel and from Rachel and Rachel's question is did theme Rachel's question is did theme Rachel's question is did theme um but I think this was actually about um but I think this was actually about um but I think this was actually about the host because sometimes the subject the host because sometimes the subject the host because sometimes the subject matter expert and the host are different matter expert and the host are different matter expert and the host are different people. Um but did the host write the people. Um but did the host write the people. Um but did the host write the intro about their crush or did a writer intro about their crush or did a writer intro about their crush or did a writer write it from their perspective? And I write it from their perspective? And I write it from their perspective? And I feel like that leads in really nicely to feel like that leads in really nicely to feel like that leads in really nicely to this next section about balancing all this next section about balancing all this next section about balancing all that information with making it fun and that information with making it fun and that information with making it fun and funny. Um, and then just want to add one funny. Um, and then just want to add one funny. Um, and then just want to add one more question on there because Lucy Lid more question on there because Lucy Lid more question on there because Lucy Lid sort of anticipated this next coming up sort of anticipated this next coming up sort of anticipated this next coming up as well and asked, ""Do you have any as well and asked, ""Do you have any as well and asked, ""Do you have any advice or resources converting advice or resources converting advice or resources converting complicated educational materials in a complicated educational materials in a complicated educational materials in a conversational tone?"" I think you'll conversational tone?"" I think you'll conversational tone?"" I think you'll kind of answer this one naturally, but kind of answer this one naturally, but kind of answer this one naturally, but just wanted to put those out there as just wanted to put those out there as just wanted to put those out there as you're as you're talking about this next you're as you're talking about this next you're as you're talking about this next one. Yeah, and I can speak to that. one. Yeah, and I can speak to that. one. Yeah, and I can speak to that. Yeah, that sex ed intro. Um, yeah, so Yeah, that sex ed intro. Um, yeah, so Yeah, that sex ed intro. Um, yeah, so Sham was our host. We had a different Sham was our host. We had a different Sham was our host. We had a different subject matter expert. Um, but we did um subject matter expert. Um, but we did um subject matter expert. Um, but we did um sort of build a framework. Sometimes sort of build a framework. Sometimes sort of build a framework. Sometimes we'll we'll write a section of a script we'll we'll write a section of a script we'll we'll write a section of a script where we say something like in brackets, where we say something like in brackets, where we say something like in brackets, you know, TK, which is the sort of you know, TK, which is the sort of you know, TK, which is the sort of journalist uh shortand for to come. Um, journalist uh shortand for to come. Um, journalist uh shortand for to come. Um, uh, host experiences. So I think what we uh, host experiences. So I think what we uh, host experiences. So I think what we had in our sort of intervening episode had in our sort of intervening episode had in our sort of intervening episode uh uh edit of this um intro was you know uh uh edit of this um intro was you know uh uh edit of this um intro was you know my first crush my first crush my first crush name um and then name um and then name um and then &gt;&gt; something etc etc and then uh I think we &gt;&gt; something etc etc and then uh I think we &gt;&gt; something etc etc and then uh I think we had sort of added the stuff about being had sort of added the stuff about being had sort of added the stuff about being boy obsessed and boy obsessed and boy obsessed and &gt;&gt; boy bands because we had also talked to &gt;&gt; boy bands because we had also talked to &gt;&gt; boy bands because we had also talked to Shan um before we started scripting Shan um before we started scripting Shan um before we started scripting about her personality and experiences so about her personality and experiences so about her personality and experiences so we could sort of fill in a little bit of we could sort of fill in a little bit of we could sort of fill in a little bit of the gaps with what we already knew about the gaps with what we already knew about the gaps with what we already knew about her and then she was able provide the her and then she was able provide the her and then she was able provide the specifics later. So, the hosts specifics later. So, the hosts specifics later. So, the hosts definitely have um a chance to add their definitely have um a chance to add their definitely have um a chance to add their sort of flare to the episodes um as they sort of flare to the episodes um as they sort of flare to the episodes um as they review them before we ship them. review them before we ship them. review them before we ship them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I would say I think my best &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I would say I think my best &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I would say I think my best advice for making complicated advice for making complicated advice for making complicated information easy to understand is really information easy to understand is really information easy to understand is really um tr um tr um tr what it was like when you first learned what it was like when you first learned what it was like when you first learned it. And that can be really hard if you it. And that can be really hard if you it. And that can be really hard if you know it really well. But if you can put know it really well. But if you can put know it really well. But if you can put yourself back in in that space of yourself back in in that space of yourself back in in that space of learning something fresh and what learning something fresh and what learning something fresh and what surprised you, what subverted your surprised you, what subverted your surprised you, what subverted your expectations, what confused you, then I expectations, what confused you, then I expectations, what confused you, then I think that helps. Um, I think oftentimes think that helps. Um, I think oftentimes think that helps. Um, I think oftentimes when we know something really well, we when we know something really well, we when we know something really well, we skip a lot of steps in explaining it skip a lot of steps in explaining it skip a lot of steps in explaining it because they just seem obvious. And if because they just seem obvious. And if because they just seem obvious. And if you can like think back to, you know, you can like think back to, you know, you can like think back to, you know, sitting in that freshman year classroom sitting in that freshman year classroom sitting in that freshman year classroom where something really hooked you for where something really hooked you for where something really hooked you for the first time um and and try to or or the first time um and and try to or or the first time um and and try to or or if you can't like talk to a person who if you can't like talk to a person who if you can't like talk to a person who doesn't know about it, I think is really doesn't know about it, I think is really doesn't know about it, I think is really good advice. We often if in some cases good advice. We often if in some cases good advice. We often if in some cases if we do have an expert writer, it's all if we do have an expert writer, it's all if we do have an expert writer, it's all the more important that we don't have an the more important that we don't have an the more important that we don't have an expert editor. We we always want uh lay expert editor. We we always want uh lay expert editor. We we always want uh lay someone who's editing the script to be a someone who's editing the script to be a someone who's editing the script to be a lay person relative to the script lay person relative to the script lay person relative to the script subject matter. Thankfully, that's subject matter. Thankfully, that's subject matter. Thankfully, that's really easy at Crash Course because we really easy at Crash Course because we really easy at Crash Course because we do a crash course on every possible do a crash course on every possible do a crash course on every possible subject and no one can be an expert on subject and no one can be an expert on subject and no one can be an expert on every possible subject. But yeah, I every possible subject. But yeah, I every possible subject. But yeah, I would say making sure someone is is would say making sure someone is is would say making sure someone is is genuinely learning it for the first time genuinely learning it for the first time genuinely learning it for the first time uh can react to that to your work on it uh can react to that to your work on it uh can react to that to your work on it and that helps a lot. Okay, I'm going to and that helps a lot. Okay, I'm going to and that helps a lot. Okay, I'm going to click back forward. I had took us back click back forward. I had took us back click back forward. I had took us back to that um intro when we were talking to that um intro when we were talking to that um intro when we were talking about that. But this is another big about that. But this is another big about that. But this is another big question we get about making things fun question we get about making things fun question we get about making things fun and funny. And I'm going to talk a and funny. And I'm going to talk a and funny. And I'm going to talk a little bit about here about just like little bit about here about just like little bit about here about just like how we think about humor here at Crash how we think about humor here at Crash how we think about humor here at Crash Course. Um so I'll start with just some Course. Um so I'll start with just some Course. Um so I'll start with just some like basic principles of humor writing like basic principles of humor writing like basic principles of humor writing that are true for any type of humor that are true for any type of humor that are true for any type of humor writing. The first is that quantity is writing. The first is that quantity is writing. The first is that quantity is the key to quality. the best comedy the key to quality. the best comedy the key to quality. the best comedy writers invisibly write dozens and writers invisibly write dozens and writers invisibly write dozens and hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, but you only see the best ones. but you only see the best ones. but you only see the best ones. [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] And so sometimes we're really hard on And so sometimes we're really hard on And so sometimes we're really hard on ourselves uh because we're like, man, I ourselves uh because we're like, man, I ourselves uh because we're like, man, I wrote five jokes and they're all bad. Um wrote five jokes and they're all bad. Um wrote five jokes and they're all bad. Um but that's because we're imagining we're but that's because we're imagining we're but that's because we're imagining we're not imagining the intense failure rate not imagining the intense failure rate not imagining the intense failure rate that real comedians are experiencing and that real comedians are experiencing and that real comedians are experiencing and just filtering before it gets to us. Um, just filtering before it gets to us. Um, just filtering before it gets to us. Um, related to that, we work hard on our related to that, we work hard on our related to that, we work hard on our team to make space for there to be a team to make space for there to be a team to make space for there to be a clown mode and an edit mode. And what I clown mode and an edit mode. And what I clown mode and an edit mode. And what I mean by that is that we try to create mean by that is that we try to create mean by that is that we try to create space in clown mode where we don't judge space in clown mode where we don't judge space in clown mode where we don't judge ourselves where we say the bad idea ourselves where we say the bad idea ourselves where we say the bad idea because maybe the bad idea will spark because maybe the bad idea will spark because maybe the bad idea will spark something in someone else that leads to something in someone else that leads to something in someone else that leads to a good idea. And if we never say the bad a good idea. And if we never say the bad a good idea. And if we never say the bad idea, then we never get to the quantity, idea, then we never get to the quantity, idea, then we never get to the quantity, which is the key to the quality, right? which is the key to the quality, right? which is the key to the quality, right? like you got to clear out all the bad like you got to clear out all the bad like you got to clear out all the bad ideas in order to make space for the ideas in order to make space for the ideas in order to make space for the good ideas. And um yeah, then later good ideas. And um yeah, then later good ideas. And um yeah, then later there's edit mode where you are there's edit mode where you are there's edit mode where you are identifying, okay, this one joke out of identifying, okay, this one joke out of identifying, okay, this one joke out of the 50 options is the best one and the 50 options is the best one and the 50 options is the best one and you're culling. And these are incredibly you're culling. And these are incredibly you're culling. And these are incredibly self- sustaining. You can only be brave self- sustaining. You can only be brave self- sustaining. You can only be brave enough to and vulnerable enough to have enough to and vulnerable enough to have enough to and vulnerable enough to have a clown mode if you know that later a clown mode if you know that later a clown mode if you know that later there will be the edit mode so your bad there will be the edit mode so your bad there will be the edit mode so your bad ideas won't be showcased. you know these ideas won't be showcased. you know these ideas won't be showcased. you know these are you really need both uh in order to are you really need both uh in order to are you really need both uh in order to have like a successful humor team. Um have like a successful humor team. Um have like a successful humor team. Um and the other thing I would say is take and the other thing I would say is take and the other thing I would say is take stock of your toolbox. Um there are all stock of your toolbox. Um there are all stock of your toolbox. Um there are all kinds of humor tools. Um humor is very kinds of humor tools. Um humor is very kinds of humor tools. Um humor is very very often formulaic. It's based on very often formulaic. It's based on very often formulaic. It's based on repeated and predictable techniques that repeated and predictable techniques that repeated and predictable techniques that are going to work again and again in new are going to work again and again in new are going to work again and again in new contexts. Um, and so just to give you contexts. Um, and so just to give you contexts. Um, and so just to give you some examples, I there are different some examples, I there are different some examples, I there are different different types of toolboxes that different types of toolboxes that different types of toolboxes that everybody can have based on your unique everybody can have based on your unique everybody can have based on your unique context. Um, so I'll tell you a little context. Um, so I'll tell you a little context. Um, so I'll tell you a little bit about the crash course toolbox for bit about the crash course toolbox for bit about the crash course toolbox for humor. humor. humor. One question we ask ourselves if we feel One question we ask ourselves if we feel One question we ask ourselves if we feel like something is not funny enough is, like something is not funny enough is, like something is not funny enough is, can we add some physical action? For us, can we add some physical action? For us, can we add some physical action? For us, uh, the cra the expectation of the uh, the cra the expectation of the uh, the cra the expectation of the viewer is that the host is going to be viewer is that the host is going to be viewer is that the host is going to be sitting at the desk. They're a talking sitting at the desk. They're a talking sitting at the desk. They're a talking head. So, anytime we can put them in a head. So, anytime we can put them in a head. So, anytime we can put them in a new space or interacting with the world new space or interacting with the world new space or interacting with the world in a new way, that's going to surprise in a new way, that's going to surprise in a new way, that's going to surprise people and that adds an element of people and that adds an element of people and that adds an element of humor. Um, so in this case, in Native humor. Um, so in this case, in Native humor. Um, so in this case, in Native American history, we're talking about American history, we're talking about American history, we're talking about busting myths about about Native busting myths about about Native busting myths about about Native American people. And um rather than just American people. And um rather than just American people. And um rather than just talking about that as a metaphor, we talking about that as a metaphor, we talking about that as a metaphor, we took it real literally and we have him took it real literally and we have him took it real literally and we have him putting the myths into a bottle and then putting the myths into a bottle and then putting the myths into a bottle and then smashing them with a bat. Um, so fun. smashing them with a bat. Um, so fun. smashing them with a bat. Um, so fun. Uh, another thing we ask ourselves is Uh, another thing we ask ourselves is Uh, another thing we ask ourselves is would it help to have a character say would it help to have a character say would it help to have a character say it? Again, both of these are these are it? Again, both of these are these are it? Again, both of these are these are pretty sensitive examples. Um, here's uh pretty sensitive examples. Um, here's uh pretty sensitive examples. Um, here's uh this is from the religions series. Uh, this is from the religions series. Uh, this is from the religions series. Uh, and we wanted to think about how can we and we wanted to think about how can we and we wanted to think about how can we talk about religious misconceptions talk about religious misconceptions talk about religious misconceptions which are essentially they're which are essentially they're which are essentially they're stereotypes about people, sometimes stereotypes about people, sometimes stereotypes about people, sometimes marginalized groups. um how can we talk marginalized groups. um how can we talk marginalized groups. um how can we talk about those um but not in a way that about those um but not in a way that about those um but not in a way that feels overly preachy or judgmental. And feels overly preachy or judgmental. And feels overly preachy or judgmental. And it really helped to add a character. So it really helped to add a character. So it really helped to add a character. So we had created this character called the we had created this character called the we had created this character called the devil's advocate. We had him FaceTime devil's advocate. We had him FaceTime devil's advocate.

Um we saw this in your joke FAQs. Um we saw this in your joke FAQs. Um we saw this in your joke examples, but other ways to finaness a examples, but other ways to finaness a examples, but other ways to finaness a joke is to think about contrast. Um, so joke is to think about contrast. Um, so joke is to think about contrast. Um, so in the I love Christmas joke example, in the I love Christmas joke example, in the I love Christmas joke example, having the presents the be as far as having the presents the be as far as having the presents the be as far as possible away from the joy of childhood possible away from the joy of childhood possible away from the joy of childhood being gone forever. If it was like being gone forever. If it was like being gone forever. If it was like presents, family, and like being a presents, family, and like being a presents, family, and like being a little tired, then that's not that's not little tired, then that's not that's not little tired, then that's not that's not as funny because the contrast is too as funny because the contrast is too as funny because the contrast is too small. I think that I think the person small. I think that I think the person small. I think that I think the person who wrote about candy coded h hurtling who wrote about candy coded h hurtling who wrote about candy coded h hurtling toward death intuitively understood that toward death intuitively understood that toward death intuitively understood that that was a good contrast. Um, another that was a good contrast. Um, another that was a good contrast. Um, another thing is being being more specific. Um, thing is being being more specific. Um, thing is being being more specific. Um, so a specific detail is always funnier so a specific detail is always funnier so a specific detail is always funnier than a broad description. That's why I than a broad description. That's why I than a broad description. That's why I think we've all heard this in different think we've all heard this in different think we've all heard this in different circumstances. It's always funny to just circumstances.

Um, so the first one I wanted to start with is from one I wanted to start with is from one I wanted to start with is from Finara, and you've talked about this a Finara, and you've talked about this a Finara, and you've talked about this a little bit, but I love the specificity little bit, but I love the specificity little bit, but I love the specificity of this question too, and thought you of this question too, and thought you of this question too, and thought you um, we could talk about it a little bit um, we could talk about it a little bit um, we could talk about it a little bit more. So, for influential but more. So, for influential but more. So, for influential but problematic figures in a topic, for problematic figures in a topic, for problematic figures in a topic, for example, Salvador Dolli in art history, example, Salvador Dolli in art history, example, Salvador Dolli in art history, how do you decide what to explain about how do you decide what to explain about how do you decide what to explain about them and what to admit for time or them and what to admit for time or them and what to admit for time or clarity? or what are some other ways clarity? or what are some other ways clarity? or what are some other ways potentially that you bring up that topic potentially that you bring up that topic potentially that you bring up that topic like you were talking about with um with like you were talking about with um with like you were talking about with um with some other series? Would Megan or Annie you want to take Would Megan or Annie you want to take it? Go for it Annie. it? Go for it Annie. it? Go for it Annie. &gt;&gt; Sure. Um yeah and and Megan feel free to &gt;&gt; Sure. Um yeah and and Megan feel free to &gt;&gt; Sure. Um yeah and and Megan feel free to add your thoughts too. Um this is add your thoughts too. Um this is add your thoughts too. Um this is something we talk about all of the time something we talk about all of the time something we talk about all of the time um because unfortunately there are a lot um because unfortunately there are a lot um because unfortunately there are a lot of problematic figures that uh we learn of problematic figures that uh we learn of problematic figures that uh we learn about various topics. Um I think part of about various topics. Um I think part of about various topics. Um I think part of it has to do with tone. We try not to it has to do with tone. We try not to it has to do with tone. We try not to sort of valorize those people um or sort of valorize those people um or sort of valorize those people um or overly praise them for their overly praise them for their overly praise them for their contributions. Sometimes we'll just contributions. Sometimes we'll just contributions. Sometimes we'll just present it factually. Um and it's really present it factually. Um and it's really present it factually. Um and it's really a case- by case basis. Sometimes it a case- by case basis. Sometimes it a case- by case basis. Sometimes it feels relevant to say and by the way feels relevant to say and by the way feels relevant to say and by the way this person is not great for XYZ reason this person is not great for XYZ reason this person is not great for XYZ reason or you know keep in mind this other or you know keep in mind this other or you know keep in mind this other thing. Um, and also sometimes it's about thing. Um, and also sometimes it's about thing. Um, and also sometimes it's about really letting them be a footnote and really letting them be a footnote and really letting them be a footnote and talking about somebody else who um talking about somebody else who um talking about somebody else who um doesn't have as scarred a reputation uh doesn't have as scarred a reputation uh doesn't have as scarred a reputation uh is from a marginalized background or an is from a marginalized background or an is from a marginalized background or an underrepresented community um because a underrepresented community um because a underrepresented community um because a lot of their contributions tend to not lot of their contributions tend to not lot of their contributions tend to not be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. So sometimes there's room to say um this So sometimes there's room to say um this So sometimes there's room to say um this person in science was a eugenicist. So person in science was a eugenicist. So person in science was a eugenicist. So take everything they say with a grain of take everything they say with a grain of take everything they say with a grain of salt. But this person over here was salt. But this person over here was salt. But this person over here was doing something really interesting with doing something really interesting with doing something really interesting with DNA or something like that where we can DNA or something like that where we can DNA or something like that where we can sort of highlight news stories from sort of highlight news stories from sort of highlight news stories from people that we don't know about. Um but people that we don't know about. Um but people that we don't know about. Um but also sometimes it's even just a footnote also sometimes it's even just a footnote also sometimes it's even just a footnote in the description like we're aware that in the description like we're aware that in the description like we're aware that this person is iffy because of XYZ this person is iffy because of XYZ this person is iffy because of XYZ reason a resource to learn more about reason a resource to learn more about reason a resource to learn more about it. So it really depends on the scenario it. So it really depends on the scenario it. So it really depends on the scenario I think. &gt;&gt; Awesome. And then Finn Brener just &gt;&gt; Awesome. And then Finn Brener just asked, ""Does a host ever make changes to asked, ""Does a host ever make changes to asked, ""Does a host ever make changes to the script on set?"" In my experience, the script on set?"" In my experience, the script on set?"" In my experience, I've never had that not happen. Uh but I've never had that not happen. Uh but I've never had that not happen. Uh but I' which we love our hosts for that. Uh I' which we love our hosts for that. Uh I' which we love our hosts for that. Uh um and but I wondered too if you could um and but I wondered too if you could um and but I wondered too if you could talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk more about the um the read through talk more about the um the read through talk more about the um the read through um the table and and that process and um the table and and that process and um the table and and that process and how that helps with that. Yeah, we have how that helps with that. Yeah, we have how that helps with that. Yeah, we have a lot of structures in place to try to a lot of structures in place to try to a lot of structures in place to try to help the host give input a number of help the host give input a number of help the host give input a number of times before we're on set because we times before we're on set because we times before we're on set because we used to have the host make more changes used to have the host make more changes used to have the host make more changes on set and we're really open to it on set and we're really open to it on set and we're really open to it because that's when a lot of playfulness because that's when a lot of playfulness because that's when a lot of playfulness can come out, but um we've fact checked can come out, but um we've fact checked can come out, but um we've fact checked everything and sometimes things are so everything and sometimes things are so everything and sometimes things are so so subtle and you lose the word 'the' so subtle and you lose the word 'the' so subtle and you lose the word 'the' and suddenly it's not exactly correct and suddenly it's not exactly correct and suddenly it's not exactly correct anymore. And um so it's hard to like anymore. And um so it's hard to like anymore. And um so it's hard to like kind of flag those things on the spot. kind of flag those things on the spot. kind of flag those things on the spot. So, uh, a couple of things we do, like So, uh, a couple of things we do, like So, uh, a couple of things we do, like Annie alluded to earlier, one thing we Annie alluded to earlier, one thing we Annie alluded to earlier, one thing we do, um, is when we have a new host, we do, um, is when we have a new host, we do, um, is when we have a new host, we have like an interview with them where have like an interview with them where have like an interview with them where we talk about like what are your we talk about like what are your we talk about like what are your embarrassing stories? What's your family embarrassing stories? What's your family embarrassing stories? What's your family like? Do you have pets? What's a weird like? Do you have pets? What's a weird like? Do you have pets? What's a weird opinion you have about the world? Um, so opinion you have about the world? Um, so opinion you have about the world? Um, so we try to get, you know, an we try to get, you know, an we try to get, you know, an understanding of what makes them tick. understanding of what makes them tick. understanding of what makes them tick. And then we we write some jokes with And then we we write some jokes with And then we we write some jokes with them and with that in mind. And with them and with that in mind. And with them and with that in mind. And with then we leave we also leave a lot of uh then we leave we also leave a lot of uh then we leave we also leave a lot of uh placeholders for them. Um, like Annie placeholders for them. Um, like Annie placeholders for them. Um, like Annie mentioned, um, then they review the mentioned, um, then they review the mentioned, um, then they review the scripts in advance. They fill in the scripts in advance. They fill in the scripts in advance. They fill in the placeholders. We encourage them to react placeholders. We encourage them to react placeholders. We encourage them to react to other parts of the script as well. to other parts of the script as well. to other parts of the script as well. So, we often get new suggestions for So, we often get new suggestions for So, we often get new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for um, you know, anecdotes, things like um, you know, anecdotes, things like um, you know, anecdotes, things like that um, at that stage. And then, yeah, that um, at that stage. And then, yeah, that um, at that stage. And then, yeah, then we do what we call a table read. then we do what we call a table read. then we do what we call a table read. It's it's a remote table read. We're all It's it's a remote table read. We're all It's it's a remote table read. We're all around a virtual table, but there's around a virtual table, but there's around a virtual table, but there's going to be the producer, the script going to be the producer, the script going to be the producer, the script editor, and the host all in a room editor, and the host all in a room editor, and the host all in a room reading through the scripts. And in reading through the scripts. And in reading through the scripts. And in those moments, um, we notice when the those moments, um, we notice when the those moments, um, we notice when the host, if they stumble repeatedly over a host, if they stumble repeatedly over a host, if they stumble repeatedly over a line, then it's probably the line, it's line, then it's probably the line, it's line, then it's probably the line, it's probably not them. Um, so we'll take a probably not them. Um, so we'll take a probably not them. Um, so we'll take a moment and we'll revise that line to moment and we'll revise that line to moment and we'll revise that line to make it sound more natural for them. Um, make it sound more natural for them. Um, make it sound more natural for them. Um, also those are moments where sometimes also those are moments where sometimes also those are moments where sometimes if a joke doesn't quite land in real if a joke doesn't quite land in real if a joke doesn't quite land in real time, we'll we'll toss the ball around time, we'll we'll toss the ball around time, we'll we'll toss the ball around trying to make the joke a little bit trying to make the joke a little bit trying to make the joke a little bit funnier. Um, if something or just funnier. Um, if something or just funnier. Um, if something or just something feels wrong, um, then we'll something feels wrong, um, then we'll something feels wrong, um, then we'll make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. Um then yeah, when we get on set, we can Um then yeah, when we get on set, we can Um then yeah, when we get on set, we can never and we would never want to fully never and we would never want to fully never and we would never want to fully um get rid of host changes on set, but um get rid of host changes on set, but um get rid of host changes on set, but we try to have like one word perfect we try to have like one word perfect we try to have like one word perfect recording and then one recording with recording and then one recording with recording and then one recording with improvisations. So that way if later improvisations. So that way if later improvisations. So that way if later when we're going through uh we notice when we're going through uh we notice when we're going through uh we notice that there's a factual discrepancy, we that there's a factual discrepancy, we that there's a factual discrepancy, we have a take with the word perfect have a take with the word perfect have a take with the word perfect version that we can substitute in for version that we can substitute in for version that we can substitute in for that portion. Thank you. Um, cool. And then we had a Thank you. Um, cool. And then we had a couple questions about working with fact couple questions about working with fact couple questions about working with fact checker fact checkers and subject matter checker fact checkers and subject matter checker fact checkers and subject matter experts. So, I'm just going to read a experts. So, I'm just going to read a experts. So, I'm just going to read a couple of them and and we can have a couple of them and and we can have a couple of them and and we can have a little bit of a conversation about it. little bit of a conversation about it. little bit of a conversation about it. So, Syjoy asks, ""Hi, Syd. Hi, So, Syjoy asks, ""Hi, Syd. Hi, So, Syjoy asks, ""Hi, Syd. Hi, Jacqueline. Is there anything you do in Jacqueline. Is there anything you do in Jacqueline. Is there anything you do in the writing process to make it easier the writing process to make it easier the writing process to make it easier for the fact checker, especially if info for the fact checker, especially if info for the fact checker, especially if info is from the subject matter expert and is from the subject matter expert and is from the subject matter expert and not a primary reference?"" what what not a primary reference?"" what what not a primary reference?"" what what happens in that situation. And then happens in that situation. And then happens in that situation. And then Sarah J also asked, ""How many subject Sarah J also asked, ""How many subject Sarah J also asked, ""How many subject matter experts do you reach out to when matter experts do you reach out to when matter experts do you reach out to when fact-checking and developing the script? fact-checking and developing the script? fact-checking and developing the script? Does it vary by topic?"" Does it vary by topic?"" Does it vary by topic?"" &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can jump in. Um, yeah, &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can jump in. Um, yeah, &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can jump in. Um, yeah, factchecking is is its own animal. Um, factchecking is is its own animal. Um, factchecking is is its own animal. Um, but part of what our scripting process but part of what our scripting process but part of what our scripting process is like is is keeping the sources with is like is is keeping the sources with is like is is keeping the sources with the claims as long as possible in the the claims as long as possible in the the claims as long as possible in the script version. So the way that we sort script version. So the way that we sort script version. So the way that we sort of structure scripts literally from the of structure scripts literally from the of structure scripts literally from the first draft that the writer does is that first draft that the writer does is that first draft that the writer does is that the last punctuation of a sentence, we the last punctuation of a sentence, we the last punctuation of a sentence, we have a comment in our Google doc where have a comment in our Google doc where have a comment in our Google doc where they link the source and the the sort of they link the source and the the sort of they link the source and the the sort of text from that source where that claim text from that source where that claim text from that source where that claim came from. And so those comments are all came from. And so those comments are all came from. And so those comments are all visible to the fact checker when they go visible to the fact checker when they go visible to the fact checker when they go in and do their fact check and they're in and do their fact check and they're in and do their fact check and they're finding independent sources that back finding independent sources that back finding independent sources that back those claims up. So, we're able to sort those claims up. So, we're able to sort those claims up. So, we're able to sort of give them a place of like this is of give them a place of like this is of give them a place of like this is where this idea came from. Um, the fact where this idea came from. Um, the fact where this idea came from. Um, the fact checker might be able to say, ""Hey, that checker might be able to say, ""Hey, that checker might be able to say, ""Hey, that source is actually outdated or there's a source is actually outdated or there's a source is actually outdated or there's a newer paper that has more accurate newer paper that has more accurate newer paper that has more accurate information now or that was debunked a information now or that was debunked a information now or that was debunked a while ago."" Um, and so we can sort of while ago."" Um, and so we can sort of while ago."" Um, and so we can sort of keep track of where the claims came keep track of where the claims came keep track of where the claims came from. Um, and yeah, we always have the from. Um, and yeah, we always have the from. Um, and yeah, we always have the subject matter expert that we have sort subject matter expert that we have sort subject matter expert that we have sort of developed the series with from day of developed the series with from day of developed the series with from day one. Um, but we also might bring in one. Um, but we also might bring in one. Um, but we also might bring in other people who have specific areas of other people who have specific areas of other people who have specific areas of expertise. This happened a lot with um, expertise. This happened a lot with um, expertise. This happened a lot with um, religions and Native American history. religions and Native American history. religions and Native American history. So, when there's particular groups or So, when there's particular groups or So, when there's particular groups or experiences that we want to make sure experiences that we want to make sure experiences that we want to make sure that um, we're getting right, but the that um, we're getting right, but the that um, we're getting right, but the subject matter expert is more of a subject matter expert is more of a subject matter expert is more of a generalist. So, that kind of um, yeah, generalist. So, that kind of um, yeah, generalist. So, that kind of um, yeah, very serious series to series. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And I think this &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And I think this might be our last question, but before might be our last question, but before might be our last question, but before we move on, I wanted to shout out Brooke we move on, I wanted to shout out Brooke we move on, I wanted to shout out Brooke in the chat who also mentioned script in the chat who also mentioned script in the chat who also mentioned script supervisors.

And then Lucy Lids asked, ""When assets?"" And then Lucy Lids asked, ""When writing the script, do you include writing the script, do you include writing the script, do you include visual descriptions as you go or later?"" visual descriptions as you go or later?"" visual descriptions as you go or later?"" &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is these are really good &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is these are really good &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is these are really good questions. Um when we think about questions. Um when we think about questions. Um when we think about animation we I mean we have to think animation we I mean we have to think animation we I mean we have to think about it any anybody would from like a about it any anybody would from like a about it any anybody would from like a sort of budget perspective.

Um so we do have to look at a script and think about like what are the script and think about like what are the script and think about like what are the parts that are the most difficult to parts that are the most difficult to parts that are the most difficult to understand without a really clear understand without a really clear understand without a really clear visual. And usually that is either that visual. And usually that is either that visual. And usually that is either that they're very technical um so we're they're very technical um so we're they're very technical um so we're thinking like the parts of the cell or thinking like the parts of the cell or thinking like the parts of the cell or something like that where you you know something like that where you you know something like that where you you know you can't keep track of there's what 30 you can't keep track of there's what 30 you can't keep track of there's what 30 different organels you can't you just different organels you can't you just different organels you can't you just can't put that in your head um or very can't put that in your head um or very can't put that in your head um or very very abstract um so if we're thinking very abstract um so if we're thinking very abstract um so if we're thinking about like uh you know like uh the about like uh you know like uh the about like uh you know like uh the origin stories of Hinduism or something origin stories of Hinduism or something origin stories of Hinduism or something like that um that are we don't ne that like that um that are we don't ne that like that um that are we don't ne that the average viewer might not necessarily the average viewer might not necessarily the average viewer might not necessarily necessarily have um anything to bring up necessarily have um anything to bring up necessarily have um anything to bring up in their imagination when we come up in their imagination when we come up in their imagination when we come up with it. Then we need to put something with it. Then we need to put something with it. Then we need to put something on screen to mix up make it a little bit on screen to mix up make it a little bit on screen to mix up make it a little bit more concrete. Or with our political more concrete. Or with our political more concrete. Or with our political theory series, when we talk about like theory series, when we talk about like theory series, when we talk about like liberalism or another philosophical liberalism or another philosophical liberalism or another philosophical concept, we have to kind of take concept, we have to kind of take concept, we have to kind of take something abstract and make it concrete something abstract and make it concrete something abstract and make it concrete often with a metaphor or a character or often with a metaphor or a character or often with a metaphor or a character or sometimes just like a graphic organizer sometimes just like a graphic organizer sometimes just like a graphic organizer like a ven diagram or a chart or like a ven diagram or a chart or like a ven diagram or a chart or something like that. That helps us keep something like that. That helps us keep something like that. That helps us keep track of we're comparing different track of we're comparing different track of we're comparing different concepts. We're thinking of this concept concepts.

The helps the viewers make a mental map. The helps the viewers make a mental map. The other thing we think about is the other thing we think about is the other thing we think about is the availability of B-roll. Um, and oh, I availability of B-roll.

Just a sometimes with dire consequences. Just a sometimes with dire consequences. Just a heads up, I'm about to go into some heads up, I'm about to go into some heads up, I'm about to go into some pretty heavy truths, so please take care pretty heavy truths, so please take care pretty heavy truths, so please take care as you watch on. Today, there is a as you watch on. Today, there is a as you watch on. Today, there is a crisis of missing and murdered crisis of missing and murdered crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. Indigenous women are indigenous women. Indigenous women are indigenous women. Indigenous women are killed at a rate 10 times higher than killed at a rate 10 times higher than killed at a rate 10 times higher than the national average. They're more the national average. They're more the national average. They're more likely than other populations to be likely than other populations to be likely than other populations to be assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, and the vast majority identify their and the vast majority identify their and the vast majority identify their attackers as nonIndians. attackers as nonIndians. attackers as nonIndians. But under federal law, tribes are But under federal law, tribes are But under federal law, tribes are limited in what they can do to solve limited in what they can do to solve limited in what they can do to solve these crimes because they generally these crimes because they generally these crimes because they generally don't have full authority to prosecute don't have full authority to prosecute don't have full authority to prosecute non-Indians, which goes back to those non-Indians, which goes back to those non-Indians, which goes back to those fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. Federal Indian law says tribal nations Federal Indian law says tribal nations Federal Indian law says tribal nations have the right to govern themselves, but have the right to govern themselves, but have the right to govern themselves, but not to exercise governance over not to exercise governance over not to exercise governance over non-natives. So, criminals can sometimes non-natives. So, criminals can sometimes non-natives. So, criminals can sometimes go unpunished through this loophole. The go unpunished through this loophole. The go unpunished through this loophole. The Violence Against Women Act has tried to Violence Against Women Act has tried to Violence Against Women Act has tried to address this problem by giving tribes address this problem by giving tribes address this problem by giving tribes jurisdiction over non-Indians in jurisdiction over non-Indians in jurisdiction over non-Indians in instances of sexual violence, stalking instances of sexual violence, stalking instances of sexual violence, stalking or assault on tribal land. But even or assault on tribal land. But even or assault on tribal land. But even then, tribal ability to punish then, tribal ability to punish then, tribal ability to punish non-Indians remains limited. Because the non-Indians remains limited. Because the non-Indians remains limited. Because the laws are so complicated, indigenous laws are so complicated, indigenous laws are so complicated, indigenous women are treated differently from other women are treated differently from other women are treated differently from other victims. And usually, this means the victims. And usually, this means the victims. And usually, this means the investigations are a lot slower, which investigations are a lot slower, which investigations are a lot slower, which makes it all too easy for the cycle of makes it all too easy for the cycle of makes it all too easy for the cycle of violence to continue. violence to continue. violence to continue. Like I said, this is heavy stuff, but I Like I said, this is heavy stuff, but I Like I said, this is heavy stuff, but I hope the more that we understand it, the hope the more that we understand it, the hope the more that we understand it, the more we can work to solve it. Now, we've more we can work to solve it. Now, we've more we can work to solve it. Now, we've seen how federal Indian law can impact seen how federal Indian law can impact seen how federal Indian law can impact individuals when traveling or when individuals when traveling or when individuals when traveling or when victims of a crime. But to take it even victims of a crime. But to take it even victims of a crime. But to take it even further, let's look at how the law further, let's look at how the law further, let's look at how the law impacts whole communities. To start, impacts whole communities. To start, impacts whole communities. To start, have you noticed I keep using the word have you noticed I keep using the word have you noticed I keep using the word Indian rather than Native American? Indian rather than Native American? Indian rather than Native American? Well, that's because federal Indian law Well, that's because federal Indian law Well, that's because federal Indian law only applies to American Indians, which only applies to American Indians, which only applies to American Indians, which unlike Native American, is the official unlike Native American, is the official unlike Native American, is the official legal term for enrolled members of legal term for enrolled members of legal term for enrolled members of federally recognized tribes. My eyes hurt from all the fine print, My eyes hurt from all the fine print, y'all. There are many people who are y'all. There are many people who are y'all. There are many people who are members of a tribe, but whose tribe members of a tribe, but whose tribe members of a tribe, but whose tribe isn't recognized as a nation by the US isn't recognized as a nation by the US isn't recognized as a nation by the US governments. So, they aren't covered governments. So, they aren't covered governments. So, they aren't covered under the American Indian label, at under the American Indian label, at under the American Indian label, at least by law. On top of that, each tribe least by law. On top of that, each tribe least by law. On top of that, each tribe has its own requirements for membership. has its own requirements for membership. has its own requirements for membership. So, you can't just say I'm Navajo based So, you can't just say I'm Navajo based So, you can't just say I'm Navajo based on your 23 and me results any more than on your 23 and me results any more than on your 23 and me results any more than I can say I'm a Swedish citizen based on I can say I'm a Swedish citizen based on I can say I'm a Swedish citizen based on my Swedish chef impression. Anyway, there's more about native Anyway, there's more about native identity in episode 4. Now, whether or identity in episode 4. Now, whether or identity in episode 4. Now, whether or not we're recognized as Indian by the not we're recognized as Indian by the not we're recognized as Indian by the government doesn't change the fact that government doesn't change the fact that government doesn't change the fact that we're US citizens with all the perks we're US citizens with all the perks we're US citizens with all the perks that come with that, like the right to that come with that, like the right to that come with that, like the right to vote. But in other ways, it could have a vote. But in other ways, it could have a vote. But in other ways, it could have a huge impact, like massive. See, as of huge impact, like massive. See, as of huge impact, like massive. See, as of 2024, 574 tribes are federally 2024, 574 tribes are federally 2024, 574 tribes are federally recognized as tribal nations. And since recognized as tribal nations. And since recognized as tribal nations. And since the 1830s, the US government has abided the 1830s, the US government has abided the 1830s, the US government has abided by what's called a trust responsibility by what's called a trust responsibility by what's called a trust responsibility to those tribes. Basically, that means to those tribes. Basically, that means to those tribes. Basically, that means it has a legal and moral obligation to it has a legal and moral obligation to it has a legal and moral obligation to protect them and their members forever. protect them and their members forever. protect them and their members forever.

So, the trust responsibility at change. So, the trust responsibility at change. So, the trust responsibility at the core of federal Indian law can be the core of federal Indian law can be the core of federal Indian law can be acted out in a lot of helpful ways, but acted out in a lot of helpful ways, but acted out in a lot of helpful ways, but this support is only offered to this support is only offered to this support is only offered to federally recognized tribes.

c7wCbbmLtiI,The Secret Language of Cults: Crash Course Lecture,"Words hold tremendous power. Cult leaders know that all too well — but so do fitness instructors, celebrities, and corporate leaders. In our world today, we are increasingly exposed to, and influenced by, complicated mazes of buzzwords, mantras, euphemisms, clichés, and redefinitions: in short, language that’s just a little bit cultish. Social commentator and author Amanda Montell presents this Crash Course lecture about linguistics, culture, and belonging. 

What’s a Crash Course Lecture?
While traditional Crash Courses on our channel break open an entire school subject, a Crash Course lecture tackles a single topic in-depth. Each lecture shares the perspective of a scholar, journalist, or thinker.

But many Native nations had never stopped fighting for their had never stopped fighting for their had never stopped fighting for their inherent right to self-govern. And while inherent right to self-govern. And while inherent right to self-govern. And while protest movements like the occupation of protest movements like the occupation of protest movements like the occupation of Alcatraz helped to finally push policy Alcatraz helped to finally push policy Alcatraz helped to finally push policy forward, self-determination had been a forward, self-determination had been a forward, self-determination had been a goal of many tribal leaders for years. goal of many tribal leaders for years. goal of many tribal leaders for years. Like in the early 60s, the Zonyi nation Like in the early 60s, the Zonyi nation Like in the early 60s, the Zonyi nation of what's now New Mexico found a legal of what's now New Mexico found a legal of what's now New Mexico found a legal loophole that allowed them to take more loophole that allowed them to take more loophole that allowed them to take more control over critical community services control over critical community services control over critical community services typically handled by the BIA. By typically handled by the BIA. By typically handled by the BIA. By replacing federal employees with elected replacing federal employees with elected replacing federal employees with elected tribal leaders, the nation gained more tribal leaders, the nation gained more tribal leaders, the nation gained more say in its own governance. Nixon say in its own governance. Nixon say in its own governance. Nixon actually pointed to the success of the actually pointed to the success of the actually pointed to the success of the Zouri in his speech, calling for Zouri in his speech, calling for Zouri in his speech, calling for self-determination, saying, quote, ""The self-determination, saying, quote, ""The self-determination, saying, quote, ""The time has now come to build on these time has now come to build on these time has now come to build on these experiences and to extend local Indian experiences and to extend local Indian experiences and to extend local Indian control."" In 1975, Nixon's proposal control."" In 1975, Nixon's proposal control."" In 1975, Nixon's proposal became a reality through the Indian became a reality through the Indian became a reality through the Indian self-determination and education self-determination and education self-determination and education assistance act. And as of 2024, assistance act. And as of 2024, assistance act. And as of 2024, self-determination remains the driving self-determination remains the driving self-determination remains the driving policy behind US tribal relations. We policy behind US tribal relations. We policy behind US tribal relations. We determine ourselves. Thank you very determine ourselves. Thank you very determine ourselves. Thank you very much. But what does this actually mean much. But what does this actually mean much. But what does this actually mean for Native Americans? Basically, for Native Americans? Basically, for Native Americans? Basically, self-determination allows Native nations self-determination allows Native nations self-determination allows Native nations more control over social services like more control over social services like more control over social services like schools, first responders, and health schools, first responders, and health schools, first responders, and health care clinics. The federal government care clinics. The federal government care clinics. The federal government still maintains oversight, and the still maintains oversight, and the still maintains oversight, and the process is convoluted to say the least, process is convoluted to say the least, process is convoluted to say the least, but it's no longer fully in charge of but it's no longer fully in charge of but it's no longer fully in charge of these essential parts of tribal these essential parts of tribal these essential parts of tribal communities. The federal government is communities. The federal government is communities. The federal government is also required to consult with native also required to consult with native also required to consult with native nations anytime they plan to propose a nations anytime they plan to propose a nations anytime they plan to propose a policy that would directly involve them. policy that would directly involve them. policy that would directly involve them.

But in the era of self-determination, most tribes era of self-determination, most tribes era of self-determination, most tribes were able to take over governance of BIA were able to take over governance of BIA were able to take over governance of BIA run schools, radically altering the way run schools, radically altering the way run schools, radically altering the way native youth were taught.

And many tribes are finding that teaching in tribes are finding that teaching in tribes are finding that teaching in native languages or using native native languages or using native native languages or using native cultural touchstones actually reinforces cultural touchstones actually reinforces cultural touchstones actually reinforces other areas of learning. At the other areas of learning. At the other areas of learning. At the Rockpoint chapter of the Navajo Rockpoint chapter of the Navajo Rockpoint chapter of the Navajo reservation in what's now northern reservation in what's now northern reservation in what's now northern Arizona, all classes are taught in the Arizona, all classes are taught in the Arizona, all classes are taught in the native language of Navajo.

And not only does it do wonders for the language itself, it do wonders for the language itself, it do wonders for the language itself, but researchers found that the students but researchers found that the students but researchers found that the students at Rockpoint scored higher in math at Rockpoint scored higher in math at Rockpoint scored higher in math compared to kids on other reservations. compared to kids on other reservations. compared to kids on other reservations. They even scored higher in English. They even scored higher in English. They even scored higher in English. Other steps were taken to protect native Other steps were taken to protect native Other steps were taken to protect native children during this period, too. Like children during this period, too. Like children during this period, too. Like in 1978, just a few years into the era in 1978, just a few years into the era in 1978, just a few years into the era of self-determination, Congress passed of self-determination, Congress passed of self-determination, Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act. This made the Indian Child Welfare Act. This made the Indian Child Welfare Act. This made it easier for a native child to be it easier for a native child to be it easier for a native child to be placed with a relative, tribal foster placed with a relative, tribal foster placed with a relative, tribal foster agency, or other member of their native agency, or other member of their native agency, or other member of their native nation. It was passed in response to a nation. It was passed in response to a nation. It was passed in response to a congressional investigation which found congressional investigation which found congressional investigation which found native children were removed from their native children were removed from their native children were removed from their homes at much higher rates than homes at much higher rates than homes at much higher rates than non-native children. Often they were non-native children. Often they were non-native children. Often they were placed with non-native families in placed with non-native families in placed with non-native families in non-native communities. And arguably, non-native communities.

And arguably, there's no better resource for native there's no better resource for native there's no better resource for native children than their families and tribes. children than their families and tribes. children than their families and tribes. Children raised by relatives are far Children raised by relatives are far Children raised by relatives are far more likely to live in a stable more likely to live in a stable more likely to live in a stable environment and more likely to be environment and more likely to be environment and more likely to be employed or in school by age 21 and employed or in school by age 21 and employed or in school by age 21 and they're less likely to be unhoused or they're less likely to be unhoused or they're less likely to be unhoused or incarcerated. But before you go thinking incarcerated. But before you go thinking incarcerated. But before you go thinking that the self-determination era is all that the self-determination era is all that the self-determination era is all glitter and roses, there have been and glitter and roses, there have been and glitter and roses, there have been and still are issues. Remember during the still are issues. Remember during the still are issues. Remember during the previous era of termination, lots of previous era of termination, lots of previous era of termination, lots of native nations lost their federal native nations lost their federal native nations lost their federal recognition, which meant the federal recognition, which meant the federal recognition, which meant the federal government ended the nationto-nation government ended the nationto-nation government ended the nationto-nation relationship they had with those tribes, relationship they had with those tribes, relationship they had with those tribes, which also meant they could no longer which also meant they could no longer which also meant they could no longer apply for funding and grants through the apply for funding and grants through the apply for funding and grants through the new policies. So, not every tribe gets new policies. So, not every tribe gets new policies. So, not every tribe gets to experience the positive effects of to experience the positive effects of to experience the positive effects of self-determination. And then there was self-determination. And then there was self-determination. And then there was corruption and fiscal mismanagement corruption and fiscal mismanagement corruption and fiscal mismanagement within the BIA itself. In the 1980s, within the BIA itself. In the 1980s, within the BIA itself.

These amendments gave tribal leaders more amendments gave tribal leaders more amendments gave tribal leaders more oversight in the way funds were actually oversight in the way funds were actually oversight in the way funds were actually being spent on tribal programs, which is being spent on tribal programs, which is being spent on tribal programs, which is what they should have had all along. So what they should have had all along. So what they should have had all along. So that brings us to today. It's now been that brings us to today. It's now been that brings us to today. It's now been over 50 years since native activists over 50 years since native activists over 50 years since native activists sailed into the waters of the San sailed into the waters of the San sailed into the waters of the San Francisco Bay and claimed an island Francisco Bay and claimed an island Francisco Bay and claimed an island prison as their own.

He had foreseen not just a collapse of the Omaha way of just a collapse of the Omaha way of just a collapse of the Omaha way of life, but a disaster that would wipe life, but a disaster that would wipe life, but a disaster that would wipe away native identity everywhere. As the away native identity everywhere. As the away native identity everywhere. As the government forced aotments onto tribes government forced aotments onto tribes government forced aotments onto tribes across the country, Big Elk's vision across the country, Big Elk's vision across the country, Big Elk's vision became a reality. Some tribes resisted became a reality. Some tribes resisted became a reality. Some tribes resisted at first. The Yankton Sue, for example, at first. The Yankton Sue, for example, at first. The Yankton Sue, for example, knew their land wasn't good for crops knew their land wasn't good for crops knew their land wasn't good for crops and wanted to keep it all for communal and wanted to keep it all for communal and wanted to keep it all for communal grazing. But federal officials use grazing. But federal officials use grazing. But federal officials use military force to persuade members of military force to persuade members of military force to persuade members of the tribe to take aotments. Many tribal the tribe to take aotments. Many tribal the tribe to take aotments. Many tribal leaders feared they'd just lose more of leaders feared they'd just lose more of leaders feared they'd just lose more of their land to settlers after the Dolls their land to settlers after the Dolls their land to settlers after the Dolls Act. And they were right. The government Act. And they were right. The government Act. And they were right. The government marked any non-allotted land as surplus marked any non-allotted land as surplus marked any non-allotted land as surplus to Indian needs and open it up for to Indian needs and open it up for to Indian needs and open it up for non-native settlers to purchase. Before non-native settlers to purchase. Before non-native settlers to purchase. Before the doll's act, native nations the doll's act, native nations the doll's act, native nations controlled 138 million acres of land. By controlled 138 million acres of land. By controlled 138 million acres of land. By the time aotment ended in 1934, they'd the time aotment ended in 1934, they'd the time aotment ended in 1934, they'd lost 2thirds of that acreage. The doll's lost 2thirds of that acreage. The doll's lost 2thirds of that acreage. The doll's act also led to the creation of tribal act also led to the creation of tribal act also led to the creation of tribal roles, list of every member of a tribe. roles, list of every member of a tribe. roles, list of every member of a tribe. The roles came with their own problems, The roles came with their own problems, The roles came with their own problems, including the creation of blood quantum, including the creation of blood quantum, including the creation of blood quantum, a way of measuring tribal membership by a way of measuring tribal membership by a way of measuring tribal membership by fraction of tribal blood, which was fraction of tribal blood, which was fraction of tribal blood, which was basically just an unscientific vibe basically just an unscientific vibe basically just an unscientific vibe check based on whether someone looked check based on whether someone looked check based on whether someone looked native. You can learn a lot more about native. You can learn a lot more about native. You can learn a lot more about that in episode 4. Tribal members that in episode 4. Tribal members that in episode 4. Tribal members assumed to be mixed race were assigned assumed to be mixed race were assigned assumed to be mixed race were assigned lower blood quantum and given US lower blood quantum and given US lower blood quantum and given US citizenship and full control of their citizenship and full control of their citizenship and full control of their aotment right away. But those assigned a aotment right away. But those assigned a aotment right away. But those assigned a higher blood quantum were presumed to be higher blood quantum were presumed to be higher blood quantum were presumed to be incompetent because they had no European incompetent because they had no European incompetent because they had no European blood. Basically, they weren't white blood. Basically, they weren't white blood. Basically, they weren't white enough. They were given a 25-year enough. They were given a 25-year enough. They were given a 25-year waiting period before they could take waiting period before they could take waiting period before they could take full control. And when they finally full control. And when they finally full control. And when they finally received the complete title to their received the complete title to their received the complete title to their allotment, many had to turn around and allotment, many had to turn around and allotment, many had to turn around and sell it because they couldn't afford to sell it because they couldn't afford to sell it because they couldn't afford to pay the property taxes. Yeah, big grift pay the property taxes. Yeah, big grift pay the property taxes. Yeah, big grift vibes from the dolls act. Thanks to the vibes from the dolls act. Thanks to the vibes from the dolls act. Thanks to the practice of aotment, many reservations practice of aotment, many reservations practice of aotment, many reservations today are a checkerboard of mixed today are a checkerboard of mixed today are a checkerboard of mixed ownership. Parcels owned by the tribe ownership. Parcels owned by the tribe ownership. Parcels owned by the tribe and tribal members are all jumbled and tribal members are all jumbled and tribal members are all jumbled together with parcels that aren't. For together with parcels that aren't. For together with parcels that aren't. For example, the Nez Purse reservation example, the Nez Purse reservation example, the Nez Purse reservation stretches across 785,000 stretches across 785,000 stretches across 785,000 acres, but only 13% of it is owned by acres, but only 13% of it is owned by acres, but only 13% of it is owned by the tribe or tribal members, which makes the tribe or tribal members, which makes the tribe or tribal members, which makes it hard to do anything that requires it hard to do anything that requires it hard to do anything that requires large connected chunks of land like large connected chunks of land like large connected chunks of land like farming and ranching or for tribes to farming and ranching or for tribes to farming and ranching or for tribes to carry out traditional activities. The carry out traditional activities. The carry out traditional activities. The effects of assimilation and aotment effects of assimilation and aotment effects of assimilation and aotment can't be understated, and they're still can't be understated, and they're still can't be understated, and they're still being felt generations later. Aotment being felt generations later. Aotment being felt generations later. Aotment left a legacy of land ownership that was left a legacy of land ownership that was left a legacy of land ownership that was at best fractured. After the death of at best fractured.

After the death of those natives who could pay the property those natives who could pay the property those natives who could pay the property taxes, ownership was split up among taxes, ownership was split up among taxes, ownership was split up among their kids and their kids' kids and their kids and their kids' kids and their kids and their kids' kids and their kids' kids' kids and so on.

[Music] [Music] [Music] Today we're talking about the first Today we're talking about the first Today we're talking about the first contact between Native Americans and contact between Native Americans and contact between Native Americans and European colonists. The story that's European colonists. The story that's European colonists. The story that's often told through this little diddy often told through this little diddy often told through this little diddy about 1492, the ocean blue, and you know about 1492, the ocean blue, and you know about 1492, the ocean blue, and you know who.

So, let's start off with misinformation. So, let's start off with misinformation. So, let's start off with a quick fact check. The only thing a quick fact check. The only thing a quick fact check. The only thing Columbus set out to discover was a Columbus set out to discover was a Columbus set out to discover was a better way to get from Spain to Asia. better way to get from Spain to Asia. better way to get from Spain to Asia. The trade route known as the Silk Road The trade route known as the Silk Road The trade route known as the Silk Road was something of a shle between Europe was something of a shle between Europe was something of a shle between Europe and Central Asia, and the Ottoman Empire and Central Asia, and the Ottoman Empire and Central Asia, and the Ottoman Empire shut it down in 1453, prompting the shut it down in 1453, prompting the shut it down in 1453, prompting the so-called Age of Discovery. So, Columbus so-called Age of Discovery. So, Columbus so-called Age of Discovery. So, Columbus proposed a mathematically incorrect plan proposed a mathematically incorrect plan proposed a mathematically incorrect plan to sail west across the Atlantic. He got to sail west across the Atlantic. He got to sail west across the Atlantic. He got funding from the king and queen of funding from the king and queen of funding from the king and queen of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, who were Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, who were Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, who were pretty psyched for all the potential pretty psyched for all the potential pretty psyched for all the potential riches and the opportunity to spread riches and the opportunity to spread riches and the opportunity to spread Catholicism around the globe. Columbus Catholicism around the globe. Columbus Catholicism around the globe. Columbus and his crew made landfall in 1492 in and his crew made landfall in 1492 in and his crew made landfall in 1492 in what's now the Bahamas and he claimed what's now the Bahamas and he claimed what's now the Bahamas and he claimed for Spain what he believed to be India. for Spain what he believed to be India. for Spain what he believed to be India. Big colonizer energy. The Bahamas were Big colonizer energy. The Bahamas were Big colonizer energy. The Bahamas were home to the Lucayans, a branch of the home to the Lucayans, a branch of the home to the Lucayans, a branch of the Arawak tribe. Columbus immediately took Arawak tribe. Columbus immediately took Arawak tribe. Columbus immediately took six Lucayans as slaves or servants in six Lucayans as slaves or servants in six Lucayans as slaves or servants in his words. So yeah, we got some serious his words. So yeah, we got some serious his words. So yeah, we got some serious myth busting to do. [Music] In the Americas, the idea of first In the Americas, the idea of first In the Americas, the idea of first contact is described like this. Columbus contact is described like this. Columbus contact is described like this. Columbus shows up in the Bahamas and boom, shows up in the Bahamas and boom, shows up in the Bahamas and boom, Europeans have met Native Americans. But Europeans have met Native Americans. But Europeans have met Native Americans. But because neither Europeans nor Native because neither Europeans nor Native because neither Europeans nor Native Americans are just one thing, Columbus Americans are just one thing, Columbus Americans are just one thing, Columbus was only the first contact between the was only the first contact between the was only the first contact between the Spanish Empire and the Lucayans. There Spanish Empire and the Lucayans. There Spanish Empire and the Lucayans. There were countless initial means between were countless initial means between were countless initial means between Europeans and Native Americans both Europeans and Native Americans both Europeans and Native Americans both before and after Columbus got lost. Like there's evidence that more than 500 Like there's evidence that more than 500 years before Columbus, the Scandinavian years before Columbus, the Scandinavian years before Columbus, the Scandinavian Vikings came to Greenland where they Vikings came to Greenland where they Vikings came to Greenland where they encountered the native Tuli people. And encountered the native Tuli people. And encountered the native Tuli people. And there were first contacts in Alaska and there were first contacts in Alaska and there were first contacts in Alaska and Hawaii, too, which we'll get into at a Hawaii, too, which we'll get into at a Hawaii, too, which we'll get into at a later episode. First contacts between later episode. First contacts between later episode. First contacts between different Europeans and native nations different Europeans and native nations different Europeans and native nations continued occurring all the way through continued occurring all the way through continued occurring all the way through the 1800s. The first encounter the the 1800s. The first encounter the the 1800s. The first encounter the sailors had with non-natives wasn't sailors had with non-natives wasn't sailors had with non-natives wasn't until 1805 when the Louiswis and Clark until 1805 when the Louiswis and Clark until 1805 when the Louiswis and Clark expedition wandered into their territory expedition wandered into their territory expedition wandered into their territory in Montana looking for horses and in Montana looking for horses and in Montana looking for horses and directions. So first contact is kind of directions. So first contact is kind of directions. So first contact is kind of a misnomer as is the idea of discovery. a misnomer as is the idea of discovery. a misnomer as is the idea of discovery.

Someone tell the Pope. tell the Pope. tell the Pope. So, if you've ever wondered how So, if you've ever wondered how So, if you've ever wondered how colonizers got away with just showing up colonizers got away with just showing up colonizers got away with just showing up to someone's home or studio and claiming to someone's home or studio and claiming to someone's home or studio and claiming it as their own, you can thank the it as their own, you can thank the it as their own, you can thank the popes. In 1493, Pope Alexander V 6th popes. In 1493, Pope Alexander V 6th popes. In 1493, Pope Alexander V 6th made a decree, also known as the Papal made a decree, also known as the Papal made a decree, also known as the Papal Bull, that any land not inhabited by Bull, that any land not inhabited by Bull, that any land not inhabited by Christians could be discovered and Christians could be discovered and Christians could be discovered and claimed by Christian rulers.

Interetra was the third in a trilogy of paple was the third in a trilogy of paple was the third in a trilogy of paple bulls that made up what's called the bulls that made up what's called the bulls that made up what's called the doctrine of discovery. And this became doctrine of discovery. And this became doctrine of discovery. And this became the legal basis for Europeans claims the legal basis for Europeans claims the legal basis for Europeans claims over indigenous lands and later over indigenous lands and later over indigenous lands and later Americans justification for westward Americans justification for westward Americans justification for westward expansion. You know the old saying, expansion. You know the old saying, expansion. You know the old saying, paper bulls gives you wings. The point paper bulls gives you wings. The point paper bulls gives you wings. The point is this defense held up in court as is this defense held up in court as is this defense held up in court as recently as recently as recently as 2005 and its impacts had been felt by 2005 and its impacts had been felt by 2005 and its impacts had been felt by indigenous peoples all over the world indigenous peoples all over the world indigenous peoples all over the world for centuries. We'll circle back to for centuries. We'll circle back to for centuries. We'll circle back to sketchy land grabs in a bit. But sketchy land grabs in a bit. But sketchy land grabs in a bit. But regardless of first, second, and regardless of first, second, and regardless of first, second, and thousandth contact, one thing's for thousandth contact, one thing's for thousandth contact, one thing's for sure, European arrival was catastrophic sure, European arrival was catastrophic sure, European arrival was catastrophic for Native American populations. While for Native American populations. While for Native American populations. While exact numbers are hard to pin down exact numbers are hard to pin down exact numbers are hard to pin down because of fragmented historical because of fragmented historical because of fragmented historical evidence, the overall population may evidence, the overall population may evidence, the overall population may have been decreased by as much as 90%. have been decreased by as much as 90%. have been decreased by as much as 90%. And you can bet that there's a detail or And you can bet that there's a detail or And you can bet that there's a detail or two missing from that chapter of the two missing from that chapter of the two missing from that chapter of the history books. A lot of that population decline I A lot of that population decline I mentioned gets blamed not on the mentioned gets blamed not on the mentioned gets blamed not on the colonizers themselves, but on the colonizers themselves, but on the colonizers themselves, but on the diseases that they carried, which led to diseases that they carried, which led to diseases that they carried, which led to major outbreaks. Historians sometimes major outbreaks. Historians sometimes major outbreaks. Historians sometimes call these outbreaks virgin soil call these outbreaks virgin soil call these outbreaks virgin soil epidemics because diseases like measles epidemics because diseases like measles epidemics because diseases like measles and smallox were new to Native American and smallox were new to Native American and smallox were new to Native American populations. So, their immune systems populations. So, their immune systems populations. So, their immune systems hadn't built up any resistance to them, hadn't built up any resistance to them, hadn't built up any resistance to them, which made the diseases incredibly which made the diseases incredibly which made the diseases incredibly deadly and widespread. And while it is deadly and widespread. And while it is deadly and widespread. And while it is true that epidemics killed many people, true that epidemics killed many people, true that epidemics killed many people, the whole truth isn't quite so the whole truth isn't quite so the whole truth isn't quite so straightforward. Research shows that it straightforward. Research shows that it straightforward. Research shows that it was disease in combination with all the was disease in combination with all the was disease in combination with all the other fallout from European other fallout from European other fallout from European colonization, including but not limited colonization, including but not limited colonization, including but not limited to war, enslavement, and starvation that to war, enslavement, and starvation that to war, enslavement, and starvation that made Native Americans especially made Native Americans especially made Native Americans especially vulnerable. And this nuance is important vulnerable. And this nuance is important vulnerable. And this nuance is important because if you focus primarily on because if you focus primarily on because if you focus primarily on disease, it obscures the truth that disease, it obscures the truth that disease, it obscures the truth that colonizers purposely killed millions of colonizers purposely killed millions of colonizers purposely killed millions of people and harmed many more. Now, just a warning. I'm about to get Now, just a warning. I'm about to get into an example of genocide. This is into an example of genocide. This is into an example of genocide. This is some heavy history, and it's important some heavy history, and it's important some heavy history, and it's important to take care. In 1848, the discovery of to take care. In 1848, the discovery of to take care. In 1848, the discovery of gold in California incited a rush of gold in California incited a rush of gold in California incited a rush of settlers who engaged in what was settlers who engaged in what was settlers who engaged in what was literally called Indian hunting. This literally called Indian hunting. This literally called Indian hunting. This practice was not only legal, but practice was not only legal, but practice was not only legal, but encouraged. In 1851, Governor Peter encouraged. In 1851, Governor Peter encouraged. In 1851, Governor Peter Bernett declared that a war of Bernett declared that a war of Bernett declared that a war of extermination will continue to be waged extermination will continue to be waged extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race between the races until the Indian race between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct. State and federal becomes extinct. State and federal becomes extinct. State and federal governments spent nearly $2 million on governments spent nearly $2 million on governments spent nearly $2 million on what's referred to today as the what's referred to today as the what's referred to today as the California genocide. In all, the native California genocide. In all, the native California genocide. In all, the native population of California dropped from population of California dropped from population of California dropped from around $350,000 around $350,000 around $350,000 at first contact to about 18,000 by at first contact to about 18,000 by at first contact to about 18,000 by 1880. And that was very much 1880. And that was very much 1880. And that was very much intentional. This is hard history to intentional. This is hard history to intentional. This is hard history to tell just right because when we focus on tell just right because when we focus on tell just right because when we focus on all the horrible things that have all the horrible things that have all the horrible things that have happened to native peoples, it can happened to native peoples, it can happened to native peoples, it can create the impression that we were create the impression that we were create the impression that we were passive throughout it, that we were and passive throughout it, that we were and passive throughout it, that we were and are victims, when in reality, we're so are victims, when in reality, we're so are victims, when in reality, we're so much more than that. For starters, not much more than that. For starters, not much more than that.

Remember when I said that the Tyino Remember when I said that the Tyino population was devastated by Spanish population was devastated by Spanish population was devastated by Spanish colonization? They were labeled extinct colonization? They were labeled extinct colonization? They were labeled extinct soon after a 1565 census listed only 200 soon after a 1565 census listed only 200 soon after a 1565 census listed only 200 naves living on Hispanola. But that naves living on Hispanola. But that naves living on Hispanola. But that doesn't tell the whole story. In 1533, doesn't tell the whole story. In 1533, doesn't tell the whole story. In 1533, the Spanish had freed enslaved native the Spanish had freed enslaved native the Spanish had freed enslaved native people, but not enslaved Africans. So to people, but not enslaved Africans.

So to keep their enslaved workers, many keep their enslaved workers, many keep their enslaved workers, many Spanish colonizers reclassified Tyenos Spanish colonizers reclassified Tyenos Spanish colonizers reclassified Tyenos as Africans. Nice loophole, guys. And in as Africans. Nice loophole, guys. And in as Africans. Nice loophole, guys. And in the early 1800s, the Spanish changed the early 1800s, the Spanish changed the early 1800s, the Spanish changed their census categories so that Puerto their census categories so that Puerto their census categories so that Puerto Ricans could identify themselves only as Ricans could identify themselves only as Ricans could identify themselves only as white or non-white.

And when it comes to the up pleasure. And when it comes to the up pleasure. And when it comes to the infamous G-spot, that arrogynous zone infamous G-spot, that arrogynous zone infamous G-spot, that arrogynous zone inside the vagina, turns out researchers inside the vagina, turns out researchers inside the vagina, turns out researchers can't really agree on exactly what or can't really agree on exactly what or can't really agree on exactly what or where it is. The G-spot's probably not a where it is. The G-spot's probably not a where it is. The G-spot's probably not a magic orgasm button, but another form of magic orgasm button, but another form of magic orgasm button, but another form of internal clitoreral stimulation. As for internal clitoreral stimulation. As for internal clitoreral stimulation. As for how we learned all this stuff, we owe how we learned all this stuff, we owe how we learned all this stuff, we owe much of what we know to the research duo much of what we know to the research duo much of what we know to the research duo William Masters and Virginia Johnson. William Masters and Virginia Johnson. William Masters and Virginia Johnson. They were a gynecologist and a They were a gynecologist and a They were a gynecologist and a sexologist at Washington University in sexologist at Washington University in sexologist at Washington University in St. Louis, famous for their in-depth St. Louis, famous for their in-depth St. Louis, famous for their in-depth research on human sexuality. Teen Chan, research on human sexuality. Teen Chan, research on human sexuality. Teen Chan, let them know. It was 1957 and Masters let them know. It was 1957 and Masters let them know. It was 1957 and Masters and Johnson were trying really hard to and Johnson were trying really hard to and Johnson were trying really hard to make their research not seem sexy make their research not seem sexy make their research not seem sexy because they needed funding to study because they needed funding to study because they needed funding to study orgasms, which weren't exactly all the orgasms, which weren't exactly all the orgasms, which weren't exactly all the rage at the time. Fortunately, they got rage at the time. Fortunately, they got rage at the time. Fortunately, they got their coin and set up a research lab to their coin and set up a research lab to their coin and set up a research lab to observe people having orgasms with the observe people having orgasms with the observe people having orgasms with the help of a penis camera. A what? You help of a penis camera. A what? You help of a penis camera. A what? You heard me. Women who agreed to be the heard me. Women who agreed to be the heard me. Women who agreed to be the subjects would essentially use it to subjects would essentially use it to subjects would essentially use it to masturbate and it would record video of masturbate and it would record video of masturbate and it would record video of what was happening inside their vaginas. what was happening inside their vaginas. what was happening inside their vaginas. Masters and Johnson learned tons of Masters and Johnson learned tons of Masters and Johnson learned tons of stuff from observing hundreds of women, stuff from observing hundreds of women, stuff from observing hundreds of women, especially about how different parts of especially about how different parts of especially about how different parts of the vagina and vulva react during the vagina and vulva react during the vagina and vulva react during orgasm. And one of their most notable orgasm. And one of their most notable orgasm. And one of their most notable findings was a model they called the findings was a model they called the findings was a model they called the human sexual response cycle. A road map human sexual response cycle. A road map human sexual response cycle. A road map for how bodies respond to sexual stimuli for how bodies respond to sexual stimuli for how bodies respond to sexual stimuli broken down into four stages: broken down into four stages: broken down into four stages: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and excitement, plateau, orgasm, and excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. At the time, medical resolution. At the time, medical resolution. At the time, medical journals weren't willing to publish journals weren't willing to publish journals weren't willing to publish their research. So, in 1966, Masters and their research.

Masters and Johnson theorized that these four stages Johnson theorized that these four stages Johnson theorized that these four stages work the same for everybody. But since work the same for everybody. But since work the same for everybody. But since then, we've learned about some key then, we've learned about some key then, we've learned about some key differences in how men and women orgasm. differences in how men and women orgasm. differences in how men and women orgasm.

These two control systems work at you. These two control systems work at you. These two control systems work in tandem throughout the whole sexual in tandem throughout the whole sexual in tandem throughout the whole sexual experience, determining if you want to experience, determining if you want to experience, determining if you want to have sex, if you can reach orgasm, and have sex, if you can reach orgasm, and have sex, if you can reach orgasm, and how that experience of the orgasm makes how that experience of the orgasm makes how that experience of the orgasm makes you feel. And because humans are a lot you feel. And because humans are a lot you feel.

When it comes to sex and different. When it comes to sex and different. When it comes to sex and gender differences, there is some gender differences, there is some gender differences, there is some evidence to support that women tend to evidence to support that women tend to evidence to support that women tend to have more sensitive brakes and men tend have more sensitive brakes and men tend have more sensitive brakes and men tend to have more sensitive accelerators, but to have more sensitive accelerators, but to have more sensitive accelerators, but those are just averages. In this study, those are just averages. In this study, those are just averages. In this study, these differences varied more from these differences varied more from these differences varied more from person to person of the same gender than person to person of the same gender than person to person of the same gender than they did between men and women.

Sexual scripts, those social Sexual scripts, those social Sexual scripts, those social expectations about how to behave when it expectations about how to behave when it expectations about how to behave when it comes to sex, can influence whose sexual comes to sex, can influence whose sexual comes to sex, can influence whose sexual pleasure gets prioritized. Like, men pleasure gets prioritized. Like, men pleasure gets prioritized. Like, men often just need PNV sex to have an often just need PNV sex to have an often just need PNV sex to have an orgasm. But 80% of the straight women in orgasm. But 80% of the straight women in orgasm. But 80% of the straight women in that 50,000 person survey said they that 50,000 person survey said they that 50,000 person survey said they usually are always orgasmed when they usually are always orgasmed when they usually are always orgasmed when they combine PNV sex with other types of combine PNV sex with other types of combine PNV sex with other types of intimacy like deep kissing, genital intimacy like deep kissing, genital intimacy like deep kissing, genital stimulation, or oral sex.

Those same sexual scripts can be reinforced in sex scenes in movies, TV reinforced in sex scenes in movies, TV reinforced in sex scenes in movies, TV shows, and porn, which often show women shows, and porn, which often show women shows, and porn, which often show women orgasming from penetrative sex alone. orgasming from penetrative sex alone. orgasming from penetrative sex alone. Like in a 2018 study of 50 popular porn Like in a 2018 study of 50 popular porn Like in a 2018 study of 50 popular porn videos, almost half of female orgasms videos, almost half of female orgasms videos, almost half of female orgasms came from PNV sex. Seeing these kinds of came from PNV sex. Seeing these kinds of came from PNV sex. Seeing these kinds of representations can lead women to think representations can lead women to think representations can lead women to think they're supposed to orgasm this way and they're supposed to orgasm this way and they're supposed to orgasm this way and fake orgasms with their partner if it fake orgasms with their partner if it fake orgasms with their partner if it isn't naturally happening. Luckily, isn't naturally happening. Luckily, isn't naturally happening. Luckily, studies have shed some light on what studies have shed some light on what studies have shed some light on what seems to help reduce the orgasm gap. One seems to help reduce the orgasm gap. One seems to help reduce the orgasm gap. One is knowing about the clitoris and how it is knowing about the clitoris and how it is knowing about the clitoris and how it works. And two is ditching those sexual works. And two is ditching those sexual works.

In a 2022 matters less than men's. In a 2022 matters less than men's. In a 2022 survey, researchers found that for survey, researchers found that for survey, researchers found that for women, both of those things together women, both of those things together women, both of those things together were related to a better time in the were related to a better time in the were related to a better time in the bedroom.

That's one treaties that they signed. That's one treaties that they signed. That's one messed up loophole. Many natives today messed up loophole. Many natives today messed up loophole. Many natives today argue that tribes should leave blood argue that tribes should leave blood argue that tribes should leave blood quantum in the past, reasoning that it's quantum in the past, reasoning that it's quantum in the past, reasoning that it's a colonial invention that treats native a colonial invention that treats native a colonial invention that treats native identity like a math problem, identity like a math problem, identity like a math problem, considering younger generations not considering younger generations not considering younger generations not native enough. If a child of two native enough. If a child of two native enough.

But on the other side, some existence? But on the other side, some existence? But on the other side, some native people think blood quantum native people think blood quantum native people think blood quantum requirements are their best shot at requirements are their best shot at requirements are their best shot at proving a lineage and preserving already proving a lineage and preserving already proving a lineage and preserving already close-knit communities. So, it's up to close-knit communities. So, it's up to close-knit communities. So, it's up to each tribe as a sovereign nation to each tribe as a sovereign nation to each tribe as a sovereign nation to decide how they want to handle decide how they want to handle decide how they want to handle membership. And some tribes are taking membership. And some tribes are taking membership.

And in case you quantum requirements. And in case you quantum requirements. And in case you were wondering, can a DNA test prove were wondering, can a DNA test prove were wondering, can a DNA test prove tribal membership? No. At most, a DNA tribal membership? No. At most, a DNA tribal membership? No. At most, a DNA test might show someone is related to a test might show someone is related to a test might show someone is related to a tribal member, but there's no tribe tribal member, but there's no tribe tribal member, but there's no tribe specific genetic marker that says, specific genetic marker that says, specific genetic marker that says, ""Congratulations, you're Navajo.""

And it also involves complex personal&nbsp; decisions. But knowing what abortion is&nbsp;&nbsp; is a key part of any comprehensive sex ed course. We won’t get too deep into the politics or&nbsp; legal situation surrounding abortion today,&nbsp;&nbsp; because those factors are ever-changing. But we will shine a light on what’s true&nbsp; about abortions, and who gets them. Hi! I’m Shan Boodram and&nbsp; this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] Head’s up: in today’s episode, we’ll be talking&nbsp; about sensitive topics, including miscarriages,&nbsp;&nbsp; and why people get abortions. So please keep&nbsp; that in mind and take care when watching. When people talk about abortion, they’re&nbsp; usually referring to the medical process&nbsp;&nbsp; that ends a pregnancy. That’s called an&nbsp; induced abortion, and that’s our focus today. But there’s also spontaneous abortions. That’s&nbsp; the medical term for a miscarriage, when someone’s&nbsp;&nbsp; body terminates a pregnancy on its own before the&nbsp; 20th week. A spontaneous abortion might require&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the same medical care used in induced&nbsp; abortions, but it depends on the specific case. A healthcare provider can share&nbsp; more information if you need it,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you can learn more about why&nbsp; miscarriages happen in Episode 9. We’ll be referring to cisgender&nbsp; women a lot in this episode,&nbsp;&nbsp; since that’s who most of the research&nbsp; and discussion focuses on, but trans&nbsp;&nbsp; folk may also need pregnancy and reproductive&nbsp; health care services, including abortions. Now when it comes to induced abortions,&nbsp; there are two main ways they can happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is by taking medication:&nbsp; two kinds of pills over two days,&nbsp;&nbsp; that are prescribed by a doctor or&nbsp; another licensed healthcare provider. The first pill stops a pregnancy from developing&nbsp; further, and the second pill empties the uterus.&nbsp;&nbsp; A medical abortion can happen entirely at&nbsp; home or partially at a doctor’s office,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it can happen up to 10 or 11 weeks after&nbsp; the first day of someone’s last period. The second kind is an in-clinic abortion,&nbsp; when a doctor uses light suction to empty&nbsp;&nbsp; the uterus. While the clinic visit may take&nbsp; longer, the procedure itself usually lasts 10&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes or less, and can happen up to 14&nbsp; to 16 weeks after someone’s last period. There’s also another version of in-clinic&nbsp; abortion that can happen up to 24 weeks&nbsp;&nbsp; after someone’s last period, which can be a&nbsp; little more involved and take a bit longer. These kinds of abortions are&nbsp; significantly less common, though. In 2021, about ninety-three percent of abortions&nbsp; in the U.S. happened in the first thirteen weeks&nbsp;&nbsp; of pregnancy, according to the CDC. And less&nbsp; than one percent happened after twenty-one weeks. As far as safety goes, surveys have found&nbsp; that when abortions are done under the care&nbsp;&nbsp; of a trained medical provider,&nbsp; they rarely have complications. A 2015 study that looked at&nbsp; data from more than 50,000&nbsp;&nbsp; patients reported that complications&nbsp; happen in about two percent of cases. Like we’ll say many times during this&nbsp; episode, though, every pregnancy and&nbsp;&nbsp; every person is unique. And if you’d like&nbsp; to learn more about any of these procedures,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can find more information in the description. Teen Shan: So, who gets abortions? And why? Good questions! The short answer&nbsp; is… well, there is no short answer. The Guttmacher Institute, which has been&nbsp; tracking this kind of data since the late 1960s,&nbsp;&nbsp; estimates that just under a quarter of women in&nbsp; the U.S. will have an abortion before they’re 45.&nbsp;&nbsp; This number is lower than it was in the past,&nbsp; and researchers point to a variety of reasons&nbsp;&nbsp; for that, like better contraception&nbsp; use and fewer teenagers having sex. But that estimate of just under a quarter of U.S.&nbsp; women represents millions of people. And when you&nbsp;&nbsp; ask that big of a group of people why they might&nbsp; do anything, you’re gonna get a huge variety of answers. One of the most widely-referenced&nbsp; studies that’s been done about&nbsp;&nbsp; abortion is called the Turnaway Study.&nbsp; It started collecting data in 2008,&nbsp;&nbsp; and surveyed hundreds of women about their&nbsp; experiences with abortion, over multiple years. As part of that study, about 950 women&nbsp; shared why they were seeking abortions.&nbsp;&nbsp; And forty percent of them said it&nbsp; was at least partly for financial&nbsp;&nbsp; reasons — either in general, or because&nbsp; of specific reasons like unemployment. Meanwhile, about twenty percent of study&nbsp; participants said they were seeking an abortion&nbsp;&nbsp; because having a child would interfere with&nbsp; their school, work, or other life opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; And just under thirty percent said it was because&nbsp; they had to focus on their other children. And when it comes to that last point,&nbsp; about already having kids — a 2021&nbsp;&nbsp; review by the CDC looked at data&nbsp; from over half a million abortions,&nbsp;&nbsp; and found that sixty percent of&nbsp; those patients were already parents. Someone might also have multiple&nbsp; reasons for getting an abortion. And some of them might have nothing to do with&nbsp; finances, family, or their living situation. Notably, some people — including about 110 women&nbsp; from that Turnaway Study — sought abortions for&nbsp;&nbsp; medical reasons. They might have a health&nbsp; condition that makes pregnancy dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp; for them, or problems might come up during the&nbsp; pregnancy that affect them, the fetus, or both. So, there are a lot of variables here&nbsp; — and there can be a lot of emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are often complicated, heavy&nbsp; decisions. And while the data shows&nbsp;&nbsp; that most abortions are to end unintended&nbsp; pregnancies, that isn’t always the case. One 2015 study reported that about four&nbsp; percent of abortions in the U.S. end a&nbsp;&nbsp; pregnancy that was intentional&nbsp; but had medical complications. Teen Shan: I see what you mean about the&nbsp; whole “there’s no short answer” thing. Mhmm, exactly. When it comes to mental health,&nbsp; surveys have found that getting an abortion&nbsp;&nbsp; affects different people in different ways.&nbsp; (You might notice a trend happening here.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is also something that researchers&nbsp; from the Turnaway Study have looked into. As a part of that larger project, they&nbsp; recruited more than 600 women who’d&nbsp;&nbsp; received abortions. And with their permission,&nbsp; they called them twice a year for five years,&nbsp;&nbsp; to ask what emotions they were&nbsp; feeling about their decision. Overall, the team found that no&nbsp; matter how the women felt at first,&nbsp;&nbsp; nearly everyone’s emotions — both positive and&nbsp; negative — were less intense after two years. And after half a decade, at least&nbsp; ninety-seven percent of women&nbsp;&nbsp; reported that getting an abortion&nbsp; was the right decision for them,&nbsp;&nbsp; even if they also said it had been&nbsp; a hard decision to make at the time. As a reminder, though, while data can shed some&nbsp; light on how a group of people can feel, and&nbsp;&nbsp; can be great for understanding the big picture,&nbsp; it also can’t tell you how everyone will feel. Like, in the Turnaway Study, about half of the&nbsp; women said that deciding to have an abortion&nbsp;&nbsp; was very or somewhat difficult — and the other&nbsp; half reported that it wasn’t a hard decision. Like we’ve said, every pregnancy,&nbsp; and every person, is unique. Now, when it comes to abortion access — at&nbsp; the time we’re filming this, in October 2024,&nbsp;&nbsp; the legal situation in the U.S. is complicated. With a case called Roe v. Wade, the&nbsp; Supreme Court ruled in the 1970s&nbsp;&nbsp; that the Constitution protected&nbsp; a person’s right to an abortion. But that ruling was overturned in 2022, and now,&nbsp;&nbsp; abortion access is largely up to individual&nbsp; states. And even when laws aren’t in limbo, it’s also something activists&nbsp; — and your local politicians,&nbsp;&nbsp; and your neighbors, and your third cousin&nbsp; on Instagram — are often vocal about. With all these beliefs swirling around,&nbsp; you might’ve heard that there's two camps when it comes to abortion: those&nbsp; who argue that abortion should be banned,&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who argue that legal&nbsp; abortion should be available. But if you dig into the research, what people&nbsp; actually think about abortion is much more&nbsp;&nbsp; complex, because it sits right at the crossroads&nbsp; of law, philosophy, religion, and science. Kind of like how cats find a way to sit&nbsp; right in the middle of whatever you’re doing. Since 1995, the Pew Research Center has kept&nbsp; track of data on what Americans think about&nbsp;&nbsp; abortion. And while those numbers&nbsp; have varied a bit over the years,&nbsp;&nbsp; the number of Americans who think&nbsp; abortion should be legal in all or&nbsp;&nbsp; most cases is usually above fifty percent.&nbsp; As of 2024, it was sixty-three percent. Teen Shan: Wait, what does&nbsp; “all or some cases” mean? Way to think critically about data, Teen Shan! So in 2022, the folks at Pew&nbsp; dug a little deeper into this,&nbsp;&nbsp; and found there’s a lot going on under&nbsp; that “all or most cases” umbrella. Things like how long a woman has been pregnant,&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the pregnancy threatens her health, and&nbsp; the circumstances of how she got pregnant — like,&nbsp;&nbsp; whether or not the sex was consensual&nbsp;or not — affected a lot of people’s answers. Overall, only about nineteen percent&nbsp; of participants supported the idea that&nbsp;&nbsp; abortion should be legal in all cases, and&nbsp; eight percent said it should be illegal in&nbsp;&nbsp; all cases. But a whopping seventy-one percent&nbsp; answered with some version of “it depends.” Here’s where that leaves us today.&nbsp; Abortion will continue to be debated,&nbsp;&nbsp; and attitudes and laws will keep evolving,&nbsp; too. We hope this data about what happens&nbsp;&nbsp; and why helps you understand this&nbsp; big, complex topic a little better. Next time, we’re talking&nbsp; about consent. See you then. This episode of Crash Course Sex Ed&nbsp; was produced in partnership with the&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsey Institute at Indiana University.&nbsp; If you are interested in learning more,&nbsp;&nbsp; visit their website for resources that explore&nbsp; the topics we discussed in the video today.

Let me explain. The members of the Chinook Indian&nbsp; Nation were skilled fishers, using nets called seines to rein in salmon they would often use for trade. They honored the first salmon&nbsp; run of the year with rituals,&nbsp; where they cooked and ate the fish before returning their bones to the Columbia River in what’s now Oregon and Washington state. In fact, the Chinook still&nbsp; practice the First Salmon Ceremony.&nbsp; Their culture is alive and well. But to the U.S. federal government? There is no Chinook Indian Nation. Hi, I’m Che Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [THEME MUSIC] Five hundred seventy-four. That’s how many federally&nbsp; recognized Native nations&nbsp; exist today in what’s now&nbsp; known as the United States. And knowing that can feel a bit…disorienting.&nbsp; I mean, that’s more than ten&nbsp; times the number of U.S. states. Wouldn’t it make more sense to just&nbsp; call them tribes, instead of “nations”? It’s not wrong to say tribe, and many Native folks use the two words interchangeably. But there’s a good reason to&nbsp; use nation in this episode. We say “nations” when talking&nbsp; about the relationship&nbsp; between tribal governments and the United States because of what they have in&nbsp; common, and that’s sovereignty — an inherent, pre-existing right to govern themselves and their territory. Meaning, essentially, to make&nbsp; and enforce their own laws. Sovereignty is the basis of a&nbsp; government-to-government relationship,&nbsp; like the one between the U.S. and Mexico. It’s how treaties get interpreted,&nbsp; Supreme Court cases get decided,&nbsp; laws get legislated, and policies get…policied? And you really can’t understand Native history — or the present, for that matter — without first understanding what&nbsp; sovereignty means in action. Native nations like the&nbsp; Chinook were running themselves&nbsp; long before the United States existed. In fact, the Chinook fed and&nbsp; sheltered Lewis and Clark&nbsp; when they came a-surveying&nbsp; the land that was not theirs. So sovereignty isn’t something&nbsp; the U.S. ever gave these nations. The U.S. recognizes tribal sovereignty, which didn’t just end with colonization. It’s right there in the Constitution,&nbsp; in a totally chill bit called&nbsp; the Indian Commerce Clause: [COLONIAL CARL] “The Congress shall have power …to regulate commerce with foreign nations,&nbsp; and among the several states,&nbsp; and with the Indian Tribes.” [record scratch] [CHE] Did you catch it? It’s…subtle. But by saying Congress can regulate trade with other sovereign governments, it’s acknowledging that Native&nbsp; nations are among those governments. And they’ll be treated that way. Not as special-interest groups. Not as random individuals. But as equally sovereign nations. And if that wasn’t enough, — spoiler: it definitely wasn’t enough — the government formally&nbsp; recognized Native sovereignty&nbsp; again in the early 1800s,&nbsp; with the Marshall Trilogy. Which sounds like a sci-fi franchise, but it’s actually a series of Supreme Court cases that say the federal government, not the states, makes the policies about Native nations. I'm lookin’ at you Georgia -&nbsp; don't make me come down there. The grand finale of the Marshall trilogy,&nbsp; Worcester v. Georgia in 1832,&nbsp; brought us this classic: [COLONIAL CARL] “Tribes are distinct,&nbsp;&nbsp; independent, political communities, retaining their original natural&nbsp; rights, as the undisputed&nbsp; possessors of the soil, from time immemorial.” [CHE] Got a real ring to it. But the same case that recognized Native sovereignty also reined it in, by classifying tribes as&nbsp; “domestic dependent nations.” “Domestic” meaning they’re&nbsp; within the borders of the U.S., “dependent” because the federal government has&nbsp; both responsibility toward&nbsp; them and power over them, and “nations” because that inherent right to govern themselves never actually went away. And if you’re thinking, “Wow, that sounds like a completely unique, complicated, and contradictory pretzel of a situation?” Yes, hello, welcome. It is. The whole “domestic dependent nations” thing&nbsp; made Native sovereignty look&nbsp; more like… “quasi-sovereignty”. Congress now had plenary&nbsp; power over Native nations,&nbsp; or the broad ability to limit&nbsp; or enhance tribal authority. They could basically decide if the U.S. government&nbsp; would treat Native tribes as nations&nbsp; or not, on a case-by-case basis. And that had big consequences for the Chinook — who I mentioned earlier – along with many&nbsp;&nbsp; other tribes. Remember, tribal sovereignty is an inherent right. So the Chinook were never not sovereign. But they needed federal recognition in order to actually act as a sovereign nation. But one thing that can help a&nbsp; tribe’s case for federal recognition&nbsp; is if they entered into a treaty with the U.S. — which several Chinook tribes did in 1851. These treaties were overseen by the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs and then shipped off to the Senate and tabled. That Congressional dismissal would be a major factor in the long fight for recognition of the Chinook Indian Nation’s sovereignty. And Congress’s power doesn’t stop there. They can also terminate a nation’s federally&nbsp; recognized status and with it&nbsp; their ability to self-govern. Which happened to the&nbsp; Chinook when they were listed&nbsp; as one of the terminated federal tribes in the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act, which took effect in 1956. We’ll talk much more about&nbsp; termination later in this series. As processes for federal recognition&nbsp; changed over the decades,&nbsp; the Chinook tried and failed to gain theirs back. And between 2001 and 2002, they were even successful, on the basis that one of the&nbsp; treaties had been ratified. But George W. Bush’s administration reversed that decision just after eighteen months. It was a huge loss for the tribe— but not the end of their fight for recognition. So why is tribal sovereignty such a big deal? Well, in the United States today, Native nations, the federal government, and the states are the only three political&nbsp; entities that have sovereignty. Being recognized by the federal government means Native nations can make their own laws and govern their own citizens. And they can set their own rules&nbsp; for who’s considered a citizen. Recognized sovereignty also means Native nations can enforce their own laws and run their own court systems. They can police their own borders&nbsp; and regulate trade within them, which can create jobs and drive economic growth. Native nations can also provide services geared toward the welfare of their citizens, like healthcare and first responders. Like, the federal government&nbsp; funds the Indian Health Service, which provided vaccines during the&nbsp; early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But members of non-federally recognized Nations,&nbsp; like the Chinook, don’t have full&nbsp; access to the IHS or its resources. So some tribal members had to&nbsp; travel hours to get vaccinated. And importantly, federally recognized nations have authority over how their lands get used. A lot of tribal lands are owned by the federal government and held in trust for the tribe, but tribes themselves have the final word on much of what happens to those lands — and states can’t meddle in the matter. And this includes things like hunting,&nbsp; fishing, and gathering rights. Without federal recognition, the Chinook don’t have clear fishing rights to the salmon that are such a big part of&nbsp; their culture and history. That means they have to pay for&nbsp; fishing licenses just like anyone else,&nbsp; even though they have an&nbsp; ancestral connection to the fish. Recognized sovereignty also means being able to collect taxes from tribal citizens, and non-citizens conducting&nbsp; business on tribal lands. States can’t tax Native nations or tribal members, but in a strange loophole, if a non-Indian buys a coffee at a tribal-owned gas station, the state can collect sales&nbsp; taxes off that purchase. Isn’t the legal system fun? By and large, recognized sovereignty means Native nations can handle their own business, without interference from the states. But Native nations and states&nbsp; sometimes enter into agreements,&nbsp; government-to-government, to&nbsp; work together on certain issues. Like, if a nation wants to open a casino, they have to enter into a compact with the state where that casino will be located. Or if the child of an enrolled tribal&nbsp; member needs to enter foster care,&nbsp; the nation and the state&nbsp; will often share resources. At the end of the day,&nbsp; sovereignty means Native nations are better able to pass on their traditions, maintain their cultural identities, preserve their languages, and determine their own futures. And without federal recognition, all of that becomes a whole lot harder. But even when the federal government acknowledges a tribe’s sovereignty, it can still have a lot of control. State laws may not be enforced in Indian Country. But Congress can give states&nbsp; some power over tribal affairs,&nbsp; in ways that diminish Native sovereignty. And it’s done so before — without consulting Native nations first. For example, in 1953, Congress&nbsp; enacted Public Law 280, which gave state law enforcement control&nbsp; they didn’t previously have&nbsp; on Native lands in six states: Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Before that, Native nations handled&nbsp; minor crimes on reservations,&nbsp; and the federal government&nbsp; dealt with any major crimes. But after PL 280 passed — again, without Native consent — the nations suddenly shared criminal&nbsp; jurisdiction with the state,&nbsp; which limited tribes’ authority&nbsp; to deal with minor crimes. On top of that, Native nations&nbsp; in those states were suddenly&nbsp; disqualified from federal&nbsp; funding to run their own courts. It’s that congressional power&nbsp; to rein in Native governance&nbsp; that makes their sovereignty a bit of a…gray area. Even though federally recognized&nbsp; tribes are sovereign nations…&nbsp; they can’t do a lot of the things&nbsp; we’d associate with nations. Like, the Navajo Nation cannot go to war,&nbsp; sign an international trade&nbsp; treaty, or make its own currency. And the U.S. has a habit of disrespecting the sovereignty that Native nations do have. Both before and after the Constitution recognized&nbsp; tribal sovereignty, colonists&nbsp; and the U.S. government actively undermined it by killing&nbsp; and displacing Native people,&nbsp; taking Native land, and trying to get&nbsp; rid of Native cultures altogether. As we’ll see throughout this series, that lack of respect for tribal sovereignty had some dire consequences for Native people that we’re still dealing with today. So where does that leave us — and where does it leave the Chinook Indian Nation? Well, in 2017, the Chinook&nbsp; filed a suit against the&nbsp; Department of the Interior and&nbsp; the Bureau of Indian Affairs claiming that they deserved&nbsp; to be federally acknowledged. But, as of this filming in&nbsp; 2024, it hasn’t happened…yet. The Chinook Indian Nation is still pursuing every pathway it can to regain their recognition. Regardless of recognition,&nbsp; the right of Native nations&nbsp; to govern themselves has&nbsp; existed since time immemorial. It wasn’t a gift the U.S. gave to these tribes. It’s something that Native nations already had — an inherent right that didn’t cease to exist when their lands were colonized. And today, Native sovereignty is the basis of a government-to-government relationship, a nation-within-a-nation situation that is… to say the least…complicated. We’ll keep exploring it a whole&nbsp; lot more throughout this series. Next time, we’ll talk about some of the scariest myths and misconceptions about Native Americans. And I’ll see you then.

XHXC0uOLOkA,Introduction to Native American History: Ep 1 of Crash Course Native American History,"Native American history didn’t begin in 1492, and it didn’t end in 1900. It stretches back thousands and thousands of years and extends into the present – and the future –  of the United States. In our first episode of Crash Course Native American History, we’ll explore why and how we plan to tell this history.

The year of whooping cough. The year of measles. The year of an eclipse. The year the white soldiers attacked. A year of peace. A year of war. This is a winter count. It’s a record of 71 years of Yanktonai history. Each picture represents a notable&nbsp; event between first snowfalls. But this is just a snippet&nbsp; of a much larger timeline. Every tribe has one—a history that’s deep, ongoing, and totally unique. And yet…they’re all unified by one thing. Hi! I'm Che Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native American History. [THEME MUSIC] First things first: there’s no way we can tell the entire history of Indigenous people in what’s now the United States. But that doesn’t mean we can’t bridge some gaps&nbsp; and add a little complexity&nbsp; to common understandings. Maybe we’ll even go crazy and&nbsp; fix some misunderstandings. Studies have shown that, across&nbsp; the board in U.S. schools, students aren’t getting much of an education when it comes to Native American History – not by a long shot. As one Navajo/Hopi student wrote in 2019, “ [...] of the U.S. history&nbsp; books used in my classroom,&nbsp; there are 307 pages and only&nbsp; 10 pages talk about Natives.” So yeah, this will be hard. And we won’t cover everything. But we’ll cover a lot of things. We hope to help answer some big questions, leave you curious about others, and really blow your hair&nbsp; back with facts about how&nbsp; Native history has shaped our world today. So let’s start with a word on words. There are over five hundred Native tribes, also called nations, within the U.S. alone. Some are recognized by the federal&nbsp; government, and some aren’t. I’m a member of the Navajo Nation—not to brag. But even that simple statement&nbsp; has layers of nuance. We call ourselves Diné, which&nbsp; means “the people.” Navajo is a name that came&nbsp; about thanks to Europeans. Some Diné folks use the term&nbsp; Navajo; others prefer not to.&nbsp; It’s a “to each their own” situation. Throughout this series, I’ll use&nbsp; specific Native nations’ names. So, if I’m talking about the Kickapoo&nbsp; or the Hualapai or the Chickahominy,&nbsp; you’ll hear me say so — with&nbsp; perfect pronunciation, to boot. Okay, I’ll try my best. And I’ll use the word “Native.” Like, a lot. I might say “Native folks” or “Native people.” But I’ll also say Indigenous. That’s the broadest term for&nbsp; people worldwide who’ve been&nbsp; living in a particular place&nbsp; since before settlers arrived. Like for example, in the&nbsp; U.S., the Aleut, the Chumash,&nbsp; and the Kanaka Maoli? All Indigenous. But the Sámi in places like Norway, the Maya in places like Mexico and Guatemala, and the Ainu in Japan are also all Indigenous. In that way, we’re kind of like cousins. Not by blood — more by vibes. You’ll also sometimes hear me say American Indian—&nbsp; a label that some Indigenous&nbsp; people embrace, and others reject. Pro: it’s been around for a long time. It’s used in U.S. laws,&nbsp; treaties, even the names of&nbsp; federal agencies like the&nbsp; Bureau of Indian Affairs. “Indian” is also just a term&nbsp; older Native people like to use,&nbsp; especially around other Native people. Con? This. Is not. India. Buddy! Another con: Even though any Native could self-identify as an ""American Indian,"" it doesn't ""officially""&nbsp; include all Indigenous people. That’s because the government&nbsp; only applies the term&nbsp; to members of federally recognized Native nations in the contiguous 48 states, but not Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians. We’ll talk a lot more about what it&nbsp; means to have federal recognition,&nbsp; as well as the status of Natives in&nbsp; Alaska and Hawaii, later in the series. For now, let’s end this vocabulary&nbsp; lesson with Native American. This term came about in the 1960s, as an alternative to “American Indian.” It’s gained a lot of ground as a go-to option. But “Native American” has its own issues! Like, the Americas are all of this business. Maybe even this? Possibly this too, but now we’re getting wild! Of course, this term isn’t preferred everywhere. In Canada, many Indigenous people prefer to be called First Nations or First Peoples, one of three categories alongside Inuit and Métis. In Spanish-speaking Latin&nbsp; America, many prefer “indígenas.” So “Native American” isn’t perfect. But it broadly describes&nbsp; Indigenous people within the U.S. At the end of the day, how Natives&nbsp; choose to identify is very personal! I call myself Indigenous. I also call myself handsome and brave,&nbsp; every morning in front of the mirror. Every Indigenous person has their own preferences when it comes to identity. Though for the record, you’re&nbsp; all brave and handsome. [mumbles] Just not as much as me. The point is, there are no definitive rules on Indigenous terminology — there couldn’t be! Like, remember how I said there are hundreds of Native nations inside the U.S. alone? Well, even that’s complicated! About forty Native nations today have territories split in half by the U.S. border. Like the Kanyen'kehà:ka, or Mohawk&nbsp; Nation of Awkwesasne to the north. Or the Tohono O’odham Nation to the south. And many, many, many Native&nbsp; nations—like the Ho-Chunk— were forced away from their ancestral homelands, and live in a totally different region today. But, with just 24 episodes, we needed to narrow down so we had room to go deep. So, that’s why we’ll be focusing mainly on&nbsp; the history of Native&nbsp; peoples in the United States. And that’s why we’re calling the&nbsp; series Native American History. I fought for the name “A Brave and Handsome History of Native America” but I was not successful. Which brings me to the paradox at the&nbsp; heart of Native American history. On the one hand, there are tons of Native nations with their own unique histories! Their own timelines! There is no single history that we&nbsp; can call Native American History. On the other hand, Native nations&nbsp; share some common experiences,&nbsp; though they’ve happened in&nbsp; different ways, times, and places. Those common experiences are a&nbsp; result of settler-colonialism,&nbsp; a force that binds Native histories together. Remember back in the intro when I said that there’s one thing that unites our histories? This is that thing! Let me break it down. We’ll start with colonialism&nbsp; — that’s where one nation&nbsp; exerts control over another&nbsp; nation and its resources without becoming part of that nation themselves. For example, colonialism describes what happened&nbsp; when the British took over&nbsp; Nigeria in the 19th century, ruling indirectly through local&nbsp; leaders and getting rich off palm oil. Nigerians still lived there, but&nbsp; their lives were never the same. The “settler” part takes this a step beyond. The goal of settler-colonialism is to remove and erase the people already living in a place, so that a new group can move in instead. And this isn’t just describing a&nbsp; single historical event or person. But yes, I’m talking about you. Settler-colonialism describes a system. And the history of the whole United&nbsp; States was shaped by this system. It’s the underlying logic behind&nbsp; centuries of wars, treaties,&nbsp; policies, and laws that affect&nbsp; Native peoples’ lives to this day. That system is part of the reason why basically any question that seems simple&nbsp; is going to be complicated! Like, take this one: “How many&nbsp; Native Americans are there?” Well, before settlers arrived in North America,&nbsp; nobody here called themselves&nbsp; “Indian” or a “Native American.” Those categories didn’t exist! We were kind of just living our lives. But in the 19th century, the federal government created a new, single Native identity, lumping all Native people&nbsp; together as a single “race”. Suddenly, in the words of High School Musical’s Troy Bolton, we were “all in this together.” The government created records of tribal members and assigned each person a blood quantum, or perceived fraction of “Indian blood.” Freaky-sounding term, right? The idea was that, over time,&nbsp; children born to Native families&nbsp; would have lower and lower blood quantums. Thinking of “Indian blood” as something that could be diluted down to zero over generations served the goal of eliminating Native people. First so their land could be taken, and second,&nbsp; to eventually relieve the federal government of its treaty and trust obligations to Natives. But — hi! Hello! — we’re still here! Plan failed! As of the 2020 U.S. Census,&nbsp;&nbsp; about 9.7 million people — or 2.9 percent of the population — self-identified as American&nbsp; Indian or Alaska Native. Though this, too, is…wait for it…complicated. It’s not clear how many of those&nbsp; people were enrolled tribal members,&nbsp; members of tribes the federal&nbsp; government doesn’t recognize, or even just people who’ve&nbsp; heard family stories about&nbsp; their great-great grandma&nbsp; being a Cherokee princess. Settlers have such big imaginations. Anyway, we’ll talk much more about&nbsp; Native identity in Episode 4. For now, let’s talk about what we mean by the “history” part of Native American History. The past five centuries have had an&nbsp; enormous impact on Native nations. But also: the past five centuries are just a blip! About twenty generations! We often use the phrase “since time immemorial” — or the beginning of time itself — to describe Natives’ deep and&nbsp; ongoing presence on this continent. We’re the descendants of the first inhabitants. We’ve been here continuously&nbsp; for thousands of years. Don’t make me math the math on&nbsp; how many generations that is. But when Native American history does get told,&nbsp; it’s usually in a way that begins&nbsp; in 1492 and ends in the late 1800s. Which might give you the impression that history didn’t really begin until Europeans showed up. Or that what happened before is unknowable. Or that Native Americans are mere extras in an A-list drama of the United States, and we mysteriously vanished by the 20th century, only a brief blurb on the nation’s IMDB page. But nah, none of those things are true. Again: hi! Hello! Still here! We made it! The past before European&nbsp; contact is not unknowable. Native peoples’ oral traditions&nbsp; hold knowledge of the past. Like, for generations, the Klamath&nbsp; people have passed down a story&nbsp; about a long-ago volcano that&nbsp; erupted and filled with water, becoming what’s now Crater Lake. And this memory of an ancient eruption? It happened! 7,600 years ago. That was about 1500 years  before anyone even started building Stonehenge. Our ancestors were very skilled at gossip. Even gossip about volcanoes. Which is why we’ll include&nbsp; stuff that happened before 1492. We’ll talk about the creation stories, worldviews, and connections to place, food, and ancestors that are thousands of years old&nbsp; and that still endure today,&nbsp; despite settlers’ best efforts to wipe them out. And we’ll also talk about how the&nbsp; settlers’ impact has persisted&nbsp; beyond the 1800s and continues to play out today. Often, you’ll catch me talking about last year and hundreds of years ago in the same breath. Because the past and the present are connected. Way closer than you might think. All wound together, like&nbsp; braids, or DNA, or Twizzlers. ‘Cause when Native American&nbsp; history doesn’t get told, the general public underestimates the ongoing impacts of colonization and discrimination. Native people get written out of&nbsp; the past and the present, too. But it’s time for that to end. Because without Native American history, there would be no U.S. history. The U.S. isn’t even the&nbsp; oldest democracy around here!&nbsp; I see you, Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Native American history is&nbsp; more than a single story. It’s hundreds of timelines&nbsp; across hundreds of nations. Each with their own unique experiences, histories,&nbsp; languages, traditions, and&nbsp; relationships with each other. We’re still here, connected in ways that transcend the attempts to erase us. And we’re shaping what happens next — whether this guy’s ghost likes it or not. [Ghost of Colonial Carl] I do not actually. [Che] I don’t care. In our next episode, we’ll&nbsp; talk about something else&nbsp; every Native nation has in common: sovereignty. I’ll see you then.

First up—they love to DIY, here’s natural methods! They know how to set&nbsp; boundaries—it’s barrier methods! These guys have progestin to give,&nbsp; say hello to hormonal methods! They’re ready to be your emergency&nbsp; contact… Let’s call up emergency methods! They are ready to commit, give&nbsp; a warm welcome to permanent methods! Teen Shan:&nbsp; What’s supposed to be over there? Game show host Shan: Oh, that's the male birth&nbsp; control pill. It hasn’t shown up yet. [Fake audience gasps] Hi, I’m Shan Boodram, this is Crash Course Sex Ed,&nbsp;&nbsp; and today we’re talking about&nbsp; how to not get pregnant. Yeah. [applause] We’ll be right back after these messages. [THEME MUSIC] A quick note on language: We’ll mostly refer&nbsp; to cisgender men and women in this episode,&nbsp;&nbsp; because that’s where most of&nbsp; the research has been done. But trans men and nonbinary people can and&nbsp; do get pregnant, and male birth control is&nbsp;&nbsp; just as important for trans women,&nbsp; as IUDs and pills are for trans men. Regardless of the genders involved,&nbsp; it takes two to make a pregnancy. One limited edition egg, and&nbsp; one tiny, tail-wagging sperm. Contraception is all about finding&nbsp; ways to make sure these two never meet. Or those two. Or… those two. Yeah,&nbsp; there’s a lot of sperm up in here. The typical ejaculation releases nearly&nbsp; two to three hundred million of them. And keeping all those swimmers&nbsp; away from an egg is no easy task. So, how do you do it? Teen Shan: Nadine’s cousin’s neighbor told me to just make sure the guy&nbsp; pulls out before he… y’know. Oh yeah, I do remember hearing that, Teen Shan. Well, more clinically, that’s called withdrawal. During P-in-V sex, someone removes&nbsp; their penis before ejaculation,&nbsp;&nbsp; so the semen goes somewhere&nbsp; outside their partner’s vagina. But there’s a reason it’s often&nbsp; called “pull out and pray.” For one, a guy has to pull out in time. And also, it’s still possible for&nbsp; sperm to be in the pre-ejaculate,&nbsp;&nbsp; the stuff that comes out before semen,&nbsp; especially if he didn't pee before sex. So all said, pulling out can have&nbsp; a one in five chance of failure. Big picture, withdrawal is what&nbsp; we’d call a “natural” method. The other big one is fertility awareness. Sometimes called the rhythm method, it involves&nbsp; a woman tracking and recording her temperature,&nbsp;&nbsp; cervical mucus, or menstrual cycle&nbsp; to predict which days she’s fertile&nbsp;&nbsp; and should avoid sex, or at least use a condom. We’ll talk more about the&nbsp; fertile window in Episode 9. According to sources like the UK’s National Health&nbsp; Service, fertility awareness can be effective. But if it’s not done perfectly, there’s&nbsp; about a one in four chance of failure. This method is difficult to get right,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it’s much tougher if someone’s&nbsp; period isn’t regular or easily tracked. For something more reliable,&nbsp; there’s barrier methods. They’re anything that blocks sperm from the goal,&nbsp;&nbsp; like the ever-popular,&nbsp; always-put-on-a-banana condom. Seriously, condom demonstrations&nbsp; ruined bananas for me. Anyway, barrier methods come in two types:&nbsp;&nbsp; the external kind that rolls on to a&nbsp; penis and traps sperm-filled semen. And the internal kind, which does exactly&nbsp; the same thing, but sits inside a vagina. Condoms are pretty cheap, at most&nbsp; pharmacies, and when used correctly,&nbsp;&nbsp; highly effective at preventing pregnancy&nbsp; and sexually transmitted infections. If you always use one perfectly, the&nbsp; World Health Organization estimates&nbsp;&nbsp; that external condoms are about ninety-eight&nbsp; percent effective at preventing pregnancies,&nbsp;&nbsp; while that number for internal&nbsp; condoms is about ninety-five percent. Teen Shan: What about the pill? I&nbsp; heard Nadine’s older sister is on it. Yep, birth control pills are another&nbsp; popular type of contraception. The pill’s an example of a hormonal&nbsp; method, which also includes patches,&nbsp;&nbsp; shots, implants, and many intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Hormonal methods block ovulation, that time&nbsp; once a month when an ovary releases an egg. Two hormones—progestin and sometimes&nbsp; estrogen—can stop ovulation from happening. And they can also make the mucus&nbsp; around the cervix super-sticky,&nbsp;&nbsp; so sperm have a harder time wiggling through. These methods are impermanent but highly effective&nbsp;&nbsp; for a specific amount of time — from&nbsp; twenty-four hours to almost a decade. But not every method works right away. It can take as long as a week for it to&nbsp; become fully effective, depending on the type. Unlike barrier methods, hormonal&nbsp; methods do have side effects,&nbsp;&nbsp; which can vary from person to person, and&nbsp; include things like nausea or headaches. Most go away after about three months, but this&nbsp; also varies between people and between methods. Also, almost all hormonal&nbsp; options require a doctor’s visit. The exception is the mini-pill, which contains&nbsp; only progestin and can be bought over the counter. The mini-pill does have some slightly different&nbsp; risks than the combined pill, though, so like with&nbsp;&nbsp; any of these methods, we highly recommend learning&nbsp; more before deciding what’s right for you. Now, I can not emphasize enough how huge&nbsp; a deal it was when the birth control pill&nbsp;&nbsp; became widely available in&nbsp; the mid-twentieth century. Creating it was a decades-long&nbsp; journey. But unfortunately, some really harmful ideas guided its development. In the 1920s and ‘30s, the movement to develop&nbsp; birth control in the U.S. became all tangled up&nbsp;&nbsp; with eugenics, the false belief that humans&nbsp; could be improved by keeping certain groups&nbsp;&nbsp; of people — including immigrants, disabled&nbsp; folks, and people of color — from having kids. This is civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. In 1961, she had surgery to remove a uterine&nbsp; tumor, but woke to find that her doctor had&nbsp;&nbsp; performed a hysterectomy—her entire uterus&nbsp; had been removed without her consent. This meant she could never get pregnant. Hamer was just one of more than seventy thousand&nbsp; people in the U.S.—mostly Black, Latina,&nbsp;&nbsp; and Native women—who were sterilized against&nbsp; their will under eugenics-inspired policies. In fact, this practice became&nbsp; so common among Black women in&nbsp;&nbsp; the South that Hamer dubbed it&nbsp; a “Mississippi appendectomy.” This was the kind of environment the&nbsp; birth control pill was developed in. Before the FDA approved the first pill,&nbsp; called Enovid, a version that contained&nbsp;&nbsp; more hormones and could have much stronger side&nbsp; effects was tested on women in Puerto Rico,&nbsp;&nbsp; who weren’t warned of the risks or even told&nbsp; they were taking part in a clinical trial. Three women died in the process. The prescription pill eventually hit&nbsp; the market in 1957, which allowed&nbsp;&nbsp; many women unprecedented control over&nbsp; their reproductive decision-making. But as revolutionary as that was, it came from a&nbsp;&nbsp; legacy of women whose reproductive&nbsp; control was taken away from them. Over the decades, new brands of the&nbsp; pill and new varieties of long-acting,&nbsp;&nbsp; reversible contraceptives—or&nbsp; LARCs—have been developed. These are “set it and forget&nbsp; it” options that someone can&nbsp;&nbsp; stop using whenever they want to get pregnant. And in 2024, the first over-the-counter birth&nbsp; control pill in the U.S. became available. But when it comes to hormonal methods&nbsp; like the pill, women often carry most&nbsp;&nbsp; of the responsibility for not getting pregnant. So, why isn’t there a male birth control pill? One reason it doesn’t exist yet is because the&nbsp;&nbsp; bar to prove a contraceptive is safe&nbsp; is higher today than it was in 1960. Good—it should be! But then there’s a less-good reason: there’s not&nbsp; the same sense of urgency to develop a male pill. Women have traditionally been responsible for&nbsp; reproduction, and they already have options. Some researchers also say it’s been harder&nbsp; to lock down the hormone levels that can&nbsp;&nbsp; disarm millions of sperm without&nbsp; risking a lot of side effects. Like, in a 2011 trial, shots&nbsp; of two hormones—progestin and&nbsp;&nbsp; testosterone—were found to be really&nbsp; good at stopping sperm production. But the trial was cut off because of side effects&nbsp; like severe acne, mood swings, and weight gain. Teen Shan: Wait, aren’t those like the same&nbsp; side effects that women can have from the pill? They are. But for women, ethics&nbsp; committees are comparing the&nbsp;&nbsp; side effects from the pill against the&nbsp; health risks of carrying a pregnancy. So, these side effects are deemed acceptable. For cis men, they’re comparing the side&nbsp; effects of those shots against… well, nothing. So, the shots don’t get the green light. Still, there’s been some recent&nbsp; progress toward a male pill. In 2023, researchers discovered a chemical&nbsp; compound that stops sperms’ tails from wagging,&nbsp;&nbsp; so they can’t swim far enough to fertilize an egg. But don’t break out the condom balloons yet!&nbsp; This compound has only been studied in mice. And there’s a long road ahead before&nbsp; it’s part of a male contraceptive. As of 2024, there is a male birth control pill&nbsp; that's in early phases of clinical trials,&nbsp;&nbsp; and there’s also a male birth control gel&nbsp; that's a bit further along in its testing The gel uses both progestin&nbsp; and testosterone so that men&nbsp;&nbsp; using it don’t produce enough&nbsp; sperm to get someone pregnant. And to apply it, they just&nbsp; rub it on their shoulders. Okay! That sounds promising. Alright,&nbsp; fine, we can blow up one condom balloon. So, today, we have natural methods,&nbsp; barrier methods, and hormonal methods. But what happens if one of those methods fail?&nbsp; For that, there’s emergency contraception. One type is the morning after pill, which can&nbsp; be accessed from a doctor, clinic, or pharmacy. It’s most effective within&nbsp; 72 hours of unprotected sex,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it has to be taken within five&nbsp; days to have any chance of working. Some types of emergency contraception are&nbsp; available over the counter in the U.S.,&nbsp;&nbsp; so you don’t need a prescription. And that one pill works for one&nbsp; instance of unprotected sex. It’s a misconception that using the&nbsp; morning after pill multiple times will&nbsp;&nbsp; cause fertility issues or other health problems. But it also isn’t meant to be your primary mode of&nbsp;&nbsp; contraception because it’s not&nbsp; as effective as other methods. Certain kinds of IUDs can also be&nbsp; used as emergency contraception. They can block sperm from meeting up with&nbsp; an egg if they’re inserted within five days&nbsp;&nbsp; of unprotected sex, and they continue&nbsp; to offer protection for years to come! But you need to see a doctor for insertion,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it’s not always easy to get&nbsp; an appointment on short notice. Now if you really don’t want to have kids? Like,&nbsp; ever? For that, there’s permanent birth control. For anyone with a uterus, this surgical&nbsp; procedure is often called “getting your&nbsp;&nbsp; tubes tied,” but really it involves either closing&nbsp;&nbsp; or removing pieces of the fallopian&nbsp; tubes, or taking them out altogether. A hysterectomy also falls in this category. For penises, you’ve got the vasectomy. It involves surgically cutting&nbsp; or blocking the vasa deferentia:&nbsp;&nbsp; the little tubes that carry&nbsp; sperm out of the testicles. So you still ejaculate, but the semen is&nbsp; spermless and can’t get anybody pregnant. Both types of permanent birth control are highly&nbsp; effective, but there is a risk of complications. Also, many people — especially women —&nbsp; have found that doctors can be reluctant&nbsp;&nbsp; to perform the procedures, citing things&nbsp; like risks and the possibility of regret. When it comes to contraception, there’s&nbsp; a lot going on here! We may not have male&nbsp;&nbsp; birth control pills yet, but there&nbsp; are still some options for everyone. And if you’re curious about any of the&nbsp; methods we talked about, the best things&nbsp;&nbsp; you can do are talk to a doctor and research&nbsp; contraceptive methods at the links below. Get curious, and you’ll find the answers—and&nbsp; the options—that work best for you. Next time, we’re talking&nbsp; pregnancy and birth. See you then. But first, here’s what&nbsp;&nbsp; you’ve all been waiting for: how to use a condom. Before opening the package, make sure it’s intact&nbsp;&nbsp; by feeling for the air bubble,&nbsp; and check that expiration date. Now, carefully open the condom&nbsp; package, just like this. Take the condom out. You’re going to hold it like this, so it looks&nbsp; like a cute little hat, and place it on the head&nbsp;&nbsp; of the erect penis, pulling back any foreskin,&nbsp; if there is any, or you can place it on a toy. If you accidentally put it on inside-out,&nbsp; you gotta get a whole new condom—otherwise,&nbsp;&nbsp; there could be pre-ejaculate on it, which&nbsp; can contain sperm, bacteria, or viruses. Then, with one hand, pinch the air out of the&nbsp; top, keeping that little tip above the head. That’s where the semen’s gonna go. With the other hand, unroll the&nbsp; whole condom onto the penis,&nbsp;&nbsp; checking that it’s snug, but not too tight. And make sure you’ve got the condom on from&nbsp; the start of sex all the way to the end. After sex is over, while the penis is still hard,&nbsp; hold onto the rim of the condom, then pull out. Then carefully take it off and throw it away.&nbsp; Look at you! You just practiced safer sex.

In words like skunk, squash, and bayou. And if any of that surprises you, well, you’re not alone. Hi! I’m Che Jim, I’m an actor, comedian, educator,&nbsp; activist, and enrolled&nbsp; member of the Navajo Nation. Growing up, I really took to the&nbsp; phrase “laughter is medicine.” It’s been a common saying among Native American people for generations. Laughter creates space, healing, and an opportunity to grow and listen. And, at its core, it’s a form of resiliency and a part of the Native American story — something I’m excited to share with all of you. Between misinformation, stereotypes, and glaring gaps in history classes, it’s common for the average&nbsp; American to have little more&nbsp; than a blurry snapshot of Native American history: one that begins in 1492,&nbsp; and ends in the late 1800s. It’s giving, “Those noble people&nbsp; who aren’t around anymore.” But Native Americans aren’t history. They’re here and now. And anybody who calls these&nbsp; lands “home” should have&nbsp; an understanding of the people who were here first —and still are. In 24 episodes, Crash Course Native American History&nbsp; will explore as many philosophies,&nbsp; stories, and traditions as we can from the hundreds of distinct&nbsp; Native nations in the U.S. And I've got some stories for you— like, have you heard the one&nbsp; about Jessie Little Doe Baird,&nbsp; who brought the language of the&nbsp; Wampanoag people back to life? Or Suzan Shown Harjo, who&nbsp; led the decades-long fight&nbsp; to change the name of Washington, D.C.’s NFL team? I could go on. We’ll also cover some Native Identity 101: like, what does it mean to be a&nbsp; citizen of a Native nation today? And, yes, we’ll talk about&nbsp; what happened after 1492, tracing how we got from treaties to&nbsp; reservations to modern tribal governments. And we couldn’t have done this alone! We worked with a team of Native experts: scholars in federal Indian&nbsp; policy, curriculum developers,&nbsp; artists, and of course me, your host. So, let’s meet back here next week. And we’ll start with a question&nbsp; that’s not as simple as it seems: What actually is Native American History? And I will see you then.

No&nbsp;&nbsp; disease is ever fun, and they can be even&nbsp; less fun when they have to do with sex. But actually? STIs are avoidable,&nbsp; treatable, and preventable. So let’s cover the facts. Because just a few&nbsp;&nbsp; key pieces of information can&nbsp; help you have a safer sex life. Hi! I'm Shan Boodram and&nbsp; this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] Where there are humans, there are germs.&nbsp; We sneeze, we get our hands dirty, and sometimes, we get sexually&nbsp; transmitted infections, or STIs,&nbsp;&nbsp; which are infections that can be&nbsp; spread through sexual contact. In fact, in 2018 the CDC estimated&nbsp; that over sixty-seven million people&nbsp;&nbsp; in the U.S. had an STI, with about&nbsp; twenty million new cases every year. And almost half of those new cases showed up&nbsp;&nbsp; in people between the ages&nbsp; of fifteen and twenty-four. When it comes to STIs, there are a lot&nbsp; of myths out there. Here’s a big one:&nbsp;&nbsp; “STIs are so common because&nbsp; they’re hard to prevent and treat.” Actually, most are pretty easy to avoid, but&nbsp; many people just don’t know how to prevent them. And most are also easy to treat. For the few&nbsp; that aren’t curable, there are options to&nbsp;&nbsp; minimize their impact on your life and make sure&nbsp; you don’t pass them on. So, let’s get into it. Most STIs can be put into one of&nbsp; two categories: bacterial or viral. The most common bacterial STIs are&nbsp; gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. They’re spread through bodily fluids or&nbsp;&nbsp; direct contact with a rash or&nbsp; sore during unprotected sex. And by “fluids,” I don’t just mean semen: Depending on the STI, “fluids” can also mean&nbsp; vaginal fluids, preejaculate, or saliva, and these can be exchanged&nbsp;&nbsp; through penetration, oral sex, anal sex, sex toys,&nbsp; or even just rubbing genitals against each other. Luckily, we’ve got a highly effective solution:&nbsp;&nbsp; wrap it up. No, not that kind of&nbsp; wrap. This kind of wrap. Thank you. One of the easiest ways to avoid catching an&nbsp; STI is to use a barrier method of protection,&nbsp;&nbsp; which prevents direct contact. Like external condoms for penises, internal&nbsp; condoms that go inside a vagina or anus,&nbsp;&nbsp; and dental dams, which can be placed over a&nbsp; vulva or an anus before engaging in oral sex. And because sex toys can also&nbsp; spread bacteria and STIs,&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s important to clean those after every use,&nbsp; usually with hot water and antibacterial soap. Condoms can also help make them safer,&nbsp; especially with new or multiple partners. But while barrier methods are really&nbsp; good at preventing STIs, they’re not&nbsp;&nbsp; perfect—they can malfunction,&nbsp; and there can be user error. That’s why STI testing and&nbsp; open dialogue among partners&nbsp;&nbsp; is so important. You can even make it flirty! “Show me your results and I’ll show you mine.” Now, if you do get a bacterial STI, there is&nbsp; a really effective cure for them: antibiotics. There are even preventative antibiotics, like&nbsp; the one called Doxycycline that someone can take&nbsp;&nbsp; up to seventy-two hours after a barrier&nbsp; method fails, or if they don’t use one. But they’re not meant to replace&nbsp; barrier methods. And at the time of&nbsp;&nbsp; recording this video, Doxycycline is only&nbsp; recommended for cis-men and transwomen. As for when to seek treatment? Sometimes, it’s&nbsp; clear that something is up down there — pain,&nbsp;&nbsp; unusual discharge, sores, or even flu-like&nbsp; symptoms with syphilis in particular. But there’s also this other myth floating around:&nbsp;&nbsp; that if you don’t have any symptoms, you&nbsp; don’t need to worry about having an STI. Here’s the truth, though:&nbsp; most STIs are asymptomatic,&nbsp;&nbsp; meaning someone might not notice&nbsp; having any symptoms at all. Teen Shan: So I could get&nbsp; an STI and not even know it? Mhmm. That’s why it’s so important to get&nbsp; tested regularly, especially if you’re having&nbsp;&nbsp; sex with multiple partners, or the person you’re&nbsp; having sex with is having sex with other people. Because even when someone isn’t showing symptoms,&nbsp;&nbsp; they’re still able to pass on&nbsp; the infection to someone else. And a long-term infection,&nbsp; even an asymptomatic one,&nbsp;&nbsp; can lead to irreversible damage&nbsp; to the reproductive organs. And hot tip: don’t just assume your doctor is&nbsp;&nbsp; testing you for STIs if they&nbsp; take your blood or urine sample. If you want an STI test, you gotta ask for it. And if you don’t feel like you can ask your&nbsp; regular doctor, you can check out your local&nbsp;&nbsp; Department of Health, Planned Parenthood,&nbsp; or another STI testing option near you. Now, bacterial STIs aren’t the only ones out&nbsp; there. There are also STIs caused by viruses. And unlike their bacterial&nbsp; cousins, viral STIs can’t be&nbsp;&nbsp; cured—but medications can keep symptoms in check. The most common viral STIs are&nbsp; herpes; Human Papillomavirus,&nbsp;&nbsp; aka HPV; hepatitis B; and Human&nbsp; Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. All of these can be transmitted through sexual&nbsp; contact with an infected person, so barrier&nbsp;&nbsp; methods are a key part of preventing them.&nbsp; But what does it look like if you do get one? Let’s start with herpes. There are two kinds. HSV-1 usually causes cold sores on the mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp; while HSV-2 usually causes&nbsp; sores around the genitals. Either way, the virus is most often&nbsp; transmitted by contact with sores,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it can also happen even when none are visible. Once someone gets it, the&nbsp; herpes virus is there for keeps. It can go dormant for long periods&nbsp; of time and then pop back up in times&nbsp;&nbsp; of stress or when their immune&nbsp; system is otherwise compromised. So, folks with herpes won’t always have&nbsp; sores but may experience “recurrences.” But even though herpes isn’t curable, it&nbsp; is very treatable. There are prescription&nbsp;&nbsp; medications that can help manage flare-ups&nbsp; and put the infection back into dormancy. Up next, there’s HPV. Unlike&nbsp; the two kinds of herpes,&nbsp;&nbsp; there are over two hundred different kinds of HPV. Which sounds scary, but for&nbsp; the vast majority of people,&nbsp;&nbsp; their immune system will clear out&nbsp; an HPV infection pretty quickly. There are a few strains that can stick around&nbsp; and cause genital warts, and other strains can&nbsp;&nbsp; cause cells at the site of infection to&nbsp; behave in a way that can lead to cancer. High-risk HPV strains most commonly cause&nbsp; cervical cancer, but can also cause other cancers. The good news is, there’s an HPV vaccine. And it’s so effective that in&nbsp; places where it’s been rolled out,&nbsp;&nbsp; researchers have seen drastic decreases in&nbsp; cervical cancer in the decades that followed. Your doctor can give you more information&nbsp; on the vaccine if you’re interested,&nbsp;&nbsp; or check your records to&nbsp; see if you already got it. And there’s also a vaccine for Hepatitis B,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is transmitted through fluids&nbsp; from unprotected sex or sharing needles. And speaking of life-saving science, here’s&nbsp; a viral STI you might have heard about before: HIV. This was once a deadly disease,&nbsp; but now it’s considered a chronic,&nbsp;&nbsp; manageable illness for those who are able&nbsp; to access care—and it can be prevented, too. HIV damages a person’s immune system,&nbsp; making it hard to fight everyday infections,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it can sometimes lead to an&nbsp; ongoing condition called AIDS. Although not everyone living&nbsp; with HIV develops AIDS. In the U.S., gay and bisexual men&nbsp; are the group most affected by HIV,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it can affect people&nbsp; of any sexual orientation,&nbsp;&nbsp; and be transmitted through many kinds of sex — or&nbsp; no sex at all, like through an infected needle. That said, anal sex is significantly riskier&nbsp; for the transmission of HIV than vaginal sex. That’s because anal and rectal tissue is thin,&nbsp;&nbsp; allowing the virus increased&nbsp; access to the bloodstream. While I can’t stress enough how important condoms&nbsp; are, there’s an added option for HIV prevention: For people who are at higher risk of being&nbsp; exposed, their doctor can prescribe a medication&nbsp;&nbsp; called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which&nbsp; is taken as a daily pill or a bimonthly injection. When it’s taken properly, PrEP reduces the risk&nbsp;&nbsp; of getting sexually transmitted&nbsp; HIV up to ninety-nine percent. There are also medications that can be taken&nbsp; if someone thinks they were exposed to HIV. If taken within seventy-two hours of&nbsp; contact, it can prevent infection. These are called post-exposure&nbsp; prophylaxis drugs, or PEP. Some people think that PrEP&nbsp; and PEP are only for gay men,&nbsp;&nbsp; but that’s not true! STIs do not&nbsp; discriminate based on sexual orientation. And if someone is HIV positive? There&nbsp; are medications like antiretroviral&nbsp;&nbsp; therapy that can help them live a normal, healthy,&nbsp;&nbsp; and long life, and prevent them from&nbsp; passing the disease on to others. And scientists around the world are working&nbsp; hard to develop an effective HIV vaccine. Unfortunately, though, there’s still&nbsp; serious stigma around HIV in most cultures. That means medicines like PrEP and PEP — as well&nbsp;&nbsp; as programs to help people afford&nbsp; them — may not be talked about. So, some people are speaking up to&nbsp; change that. Teen Shan, let ’em know. This is the famed, the fabulous,&nbsp; the ever-fashionable Billy Porter. He was diagnosed HIV-positive in 2007, and&nbsp; kept it private for more than a decade. In the religious family he grew up in,&nbsp; HIV was considered a punishment from God. And as an actor, there was a chance his&nbsp; disease would prevent him from getting work. But in 2021, he took his diagnosis public.&nbsp; “There’s no more stigma,” he said in an interview. “Let’s be done with that.” And Porter’s joined by others&nbsp; with HIV in stopping the stigma,&nbsp;&nbsp; from NBA star Magic Johnson, to&nbsp; “Queer Eye” host Jonathan van Ness. As Van Ness put it on social media, “We have&nbsp; come a long way in the fight against HIV/AIDS,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there is so much work left to be done.” So, getting an STI doesn’t have to be a world-shattering thing — or&nbsp; something to be ashamed of. Overall, understanding how to prevent&nbsp; STIs, being aware of your own body,&nbsp;&nbsp; and communicating with your&nbsp; partners and your doctor are key. We’re all just trying to help each other&nbsp; live our safest, healthiest sex lives. Ooh! Speaking of prevention — next time, we’re&nbsp; talking about contraception. See you then.

[gasps] Hi, I’m Shan Boodram, this is Crash Course Sex&nbsp; Ed, and today we’re talking about virginity:&nbsp;&nbsp; is it really a thing? We’ll be&nbsp; back right after these messages. [THEME MUSIC] When someone thinks “virgin,” their&nbsp; mind often goes to the only sex act&nbsp;&nbsp; that can make a baby: penis-in-vagina. Which is complicated, since that’s&nbsp; not what all sex looks like,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it’s where we’ll camp out for today. Nobody knows exactly when we&nbsp; started caring about virginity,&nbsp;&nbsp; but a leading theory is that it goes all&nbsp; the way back to the invention of farming. Which sounds like I made it up, but&nbsp; I swear I’m not messing with you. Farming coincided with the invention of&nbsp; property. So suddenly, ownership mattered:&nbsp;&nbsp; my land, my crops, my stuff—and, hold&nbsp; on, which one of these kids is mine? In these patriarchal societies, “Who’s&nbsp; your daddy?” was an important question. And the only way for men to be sure about&nbsp; their biological dadhood was to invent&nbsp;&nbsp; a system where women were expected&nbsp; to reserve sex for their husbands. Old MacDonald had a farm... and&nbsp; control over his wife's sex life. Over the centuries, virginity&nbsp; became a whole thing in the West,&nbsp;&nbsp; embedded in everything from artwork&nbsp; and religion to laws and teen movies. And premarital virginity became such a&nbsp; prized quality in women, people were like,&nbsp;&nbsp; “No no no no, we can’t just take her word for it.&nbsp; We need to prove that she’s telling the truth.” In 17th-century England, people theorized&nbsp;&nbsp; you could tell a virgin from&nbsp; the proportions of her neck. Before that, in Renaissance Europe, it was thought&nbsp;&nbsp; that a virgin could be sussed out&nbsp; based on the clarity of her pee. And of course, virginity detectives&nbsp; have long honed in on the hymen. Don’t know her? She’s a thin membrane near&nbsp; the opening of the vagina. Literally just some tissue left over after the&nbsp; vagina forms during fetal development. You may have heard that the hymen&nbsp; breaks—like the seal on a jar—the&nbsp;&nbsp; first time a person with a vagina has P-in-V sex. Changing them physically forever. But it doesn’t work like that. And it’s nothing&nbsp; like popping a cherry, so let’s just ban that&nbsp;&nbsp; phrase forever. Some people with vaginas&nbsp; don’t have much of a hymen to begin with. And for those who do, that tissue often thins&nbsp; away way before they’re sexually active,&nbsp;&nbsp; from exercising, riding a bike,&nbsp; using a tampon, or just existing. Many people never know their hymen’s&nbsp; there, much less when it’s gone. Still, this myth is so globally pervasive that&nbsp; some parents still ask doctors to “test” their&nbsp;&nbsp; child’s virginity by checking the hymen and the&nbsp; stretchiness of the vagina… but according to&nbsp;&nbsp; medical experts, neither of those things tell you&nbsp; anything about whether that person has had sex. The vagina doesn’t permanently stretch out the&nbsp; first, or any of the times that someone has sex. The va-jay-jay is like a rubber&nbsp; band; it just bounces back. Trust me on that one, I birthed two babies. It’s also a myth that a person with a vagina&nbsp; always bleeds or experiences pain the first&nbsp;&nbsp; time they have sex. It can happen, but not always.&nbsp; And it might have nothing to do with the hymen. Discomfort can happen for lots of reasons,&nbsp; including tension, position, speed,&nbsp;&nbsp; or not being lubricated enough—even&nbsp; if it’s your three-thousandth time. Sex doesn’t have to be painful, and if it&nbsp; is, your doctor can help you out with that. All of this is to say: virginity is not a medical&nbsp; reality. There’s no physical way of telling&nbsp;&nbsp; whether a person has had penis-in-vagina sex—not&nbsp; from the hymen any more than from the earlobe. So if virginity isn’t a physical&nbsp; state of being, what is it? Think of virginity like money. It’s real in&nbsp; the sense that some people care a lot about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it impacts our lives — I mean, having&nbsp; sex for the first time is a real experience. And it can be a big moment in someone’s&nbsp; life! But the value we assign to virginity?&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s something that cultures have just made up. More specifically, virginity is an&nbsp; example of a sexual script—one of&nbsp;&nbsp; the many social expectations about&nbsp; how to behave when it comes to sex. This idea was first proposed in the 1960s by&nbsp; sociologists John Gagnon and William Simon,&nbsp;&nbsp; who argued that human sexuality is less driven&nbsp;&nbsp; by biological instincts than&nbsp; the social meanings we create. You can think of scripts like stage&nbsp; directions in a given time and place. Like, if you send me the eggplant&nbsp; emoji, I’m gonna think you’re flirting. Sexual scripts train people in what’s “normal” or&nbsp; “correct” sexual behavior, and they often interact&nbsp;&nbsp; with scripts for gender—society’s&nbsp; type-cast roles for men and women. On top of that, traditional sexual scripts&nbsp; in the West are highly heteronormative,&nbsp;&nbsp; presuming that only men and&nbsp; women have sex with each other. Oh, and those women sharing a life&nbsp; together? Yeah, they’re just roommates. Like, here’s a sexual script you might have heard&nbsp; before: Men mainly care about the physical parts&nbsp;&nbsp; of sex, and the emotional relationship with&nbsp; their partner… well that’s less important. Meanwhile, for women, it’s all about the emotions. But those traditional scripts aren’t for&nbsp; everybody, and if they don’t work for you,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can write your own story. Especially when&nbsp; the scripts handed to you do more harm than good. For example, multiple studies have&nbsp; found that women living in cultures&nbsp;&nbsp; that prize virginity are often more reluctant to&nbsp;&nbsp; have conversations about sexual health&nbsp; or access certain types of healthcare. Take Pap smears. They involve swabbing&nbsp; the cervix to check for cancerous cells,&nbsp;&nbsp; and are recommended for everyone&nbsp; with a vagina who’s over twenty-one. But in cultures that value purity,&nbsp; some women avoid getting the procedure,&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking it’ll threaten their status as a&nbsp; virgin or reveal that they have had P-in-V sex. And like we talked about in Episode 4,&nbsp;&nbsp; gendered sexual scripts often cast people&nbsp; in rigid roles they didn’t choose. Like, that script about men not prioritizing emotional&nbsp; intimacy? That starts developing early, as boys get cast in gender&nbsp; roles that go something like:&nbsp;&nbsp; “Explore! Be assertive! But&nbsp; don’t talk about feelings!” Compare that with the script&nbsp; traditionally handed to girls:&nbsp;&nbsp; “Settle down! Be careful!&nbsp; Think of others’ feelings!” Growing up with these scripts&nbsp; can shape our expectations,&nbsp;&nbsp; creating miscommunications that make it seem&nbsp; like men and women are innately different. So different they might as&nbsp; well be from different planets,&nbsp;&nbsp; a claim made by the 1992 book ""Men&nbsp; Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"". In it, you’ll find statements like: men like the&nbsp; news, the weather, gadgets, gizmos, and uniforms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Women care about feelings, beauty, relationships,&nbsp; and wearing a different outfit every day. But these claims aren’t well supported by&nbsp; research. The gender similarities hypothesis,  proposed by psychologist Janet Hyde,&nbsp;&nbsp; asserts that men and women are&nbsp; more alike than they are different. In a study on areas where men and&nbsp; women are often assumed to part ways,&nbsp;&nbsp; like math skills and the gift of gab, Hyde&nbsp; found no statistically significant differences. When it came to sexuality, the&nbsp; largest gender differences were&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency of masturbation and&nbsp; attitudes toward casual sex. But how much of that ties into sexual scripts? Some researchers have also pointed&nbsp; out that boys are taught to touch&nbsp;&nbsp; their genitals from an early age&nbsp; so they can aim while peeing,&nbsp;&nbsp; which can lead to more exploration, and more&nbsp; experience with what feels good to them. “For kids your age it’s just something normal” Meanwhile, girls are often taught that their&nbsp; vulva is something they shouldn’t touch. [TV test sound effect] And can we really talk about attitudes&nbsp; toward casual sex without addressing the&nbsp;&nbsp; virgin script in the room? That gendered&nbsp; double-standard that tells girls it’s&nbsp;&nbsp; shameful to have sex while telling&nbsp; boys it’s shameful to be a virgin? Or how about the flip that happens&nbsp; as we get older, from “Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp; you’re too young to have sex!” to “What&nbsp; do you mean you haven’t done it yet?” Either way, decades of research show that&nbsp; these narrow scripts are not good for us. The good news is, these scripts don’t have to&nbsp; be your story. Your culture hands you a draft,&nbsp;&nbsp; not a blueprint of how to live your life. Even people who like the traditional script may&nbsp;&nbsp; find it limiting at some point—like&nbsp; when a man needs to cry, or a woman&nbsp;&nbsp; wants to enjoy some casual sex without&nbsp; getting branded with a scarlet letter! So, go ahead: Edit them, scribble in the margins,&nbsp; write your own plot. For years, I was told that&nbsp;&nbsp; my first experience of P-in-V sex was “bad”&nbsp; because it didn’t look like most people’s. And it wasn't until I took a&nbsp; big ol' red marker to the virginity&nbsp;&nbsp; script that I was able to own and&nbsp; appreciate my story. And the more freedom we grant each other to write our&nbsp; own stories, the better off we all are. So is virginity really a thing? Well, it isn’t a physical absolute, and&nbsp; it doesn’t have any inherent value. It’s one of the many scripts our culture hands to us. But those aren’t objective truths, and you&nbsp; get to decide which parts you want to keep,&nbsp;&nbsp; and which parts you want to write yourself. Next time, we’re busting myths&nbsp; about STIs. See you then. This episode of Crash Course Sex Ed was produced&nbsp;&nbsp; in partnership with the Kinsey&nbsp; Institute at Indiana University.

Sexual orientation might line up with who&nbsp; someone’s actually having sex with, or how they&nbsp;&nbsp; publicly identify, or it might not, for lots of&nbsp; reasons. We talked about that more in Episode 1. For now, though, here’s the big thing&nbsp; to know: Sexual orientation exists&nbsp;&nbsp; on a spectrum—not just two opposites,&nbsp; but all the possibilities in-between. So, on one end of the spectrum, if you’re&nbsp; straight, that means you’re a woman who’s&nbsp;&nbsp; exclusively attracted to men, or a man&nbsp; who’s exclusively attracted to women.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s the same as being heterosexual,&nbsp; the prefix “hetero” meaning “other.” Now, on the other end, if you’re lesbian or gay,&nbsp; you’re a woman who’s exclusively attracted to&nbsp;&nbsp; women, or a man who’s exclusively attracted&nbsp; to men. Both can be considered homosexual,&nbsp;&nbsp; the prefix “homo” meaning “same”—although&nbsp; that term can be seen as dated. But there are tons of other sexual&nbsp; identities in-between those two,&nbsp;&nbsp; often lumped together under&nbsp; the “LGBTQIA+” umbrella. Teen Shan: Should I say all the&nbsp; letters one by one like that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or should I pronounce it like eljibbitycueaiah? Shan: Definitely one by one. We’re gonna get into that acronym a bit&nbsp; later, because it hasn’t been around forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it comes to all the variation in human&nbsp; sexuality? That’s been documented for centuries. Diversity in sexuality was the norm in&nbsp; various cultures across the ancient world,&nbsp;&nbsp; from China to Egypt to Rome. Alexander the&nbsp; Great famously had both male and female lovers. But right now, it’s illegal to&nbsp; be gay in sixty-four countries,&nbsp;&nbsp; and in twelve of those, it’s punishable&nbsp; by life in prison or even death. And even in countries where being&nbsp; gay is legal, like the U.S.,&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s not universally accepted. So what happened? Well, different prejudices around same-sex&nbsp; intercourse have existed for ages,&nbsp;&nbsp; driven by religion and cultural beliefs.&nbsp; But the fire really sparked soon after&nbsp;&nbsp; Christianity came to ancient Rome,&nbsp; thanks to scripture prohibiting it. And in the 1200s, Christian philosopher&nbsp; Thomas Aquinas fanned the flames,&nbsp;&nbsp; claiming that same-sex intercourse was against&nbsp; the natural order of things God had created. This idea that homosexual behavior is&nbsp; “unnatural” spread even further as a&nbsp;&nbsp; result of Christian missionary&nbsp; work and European colonization.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it’s been doing damage for&nbsp; more than eight hundred years. Like, flash forward to the 1950s, when&nbsp; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical Disorders, the guide psychiatrists&nbsp; use to make diagnoses, was first published. It didn’t call homosexuality a sin, but it&nbsp; did carry on the prejudices of the past by&nbsp;&nbsp; classifying it as a mental illness. It took&nbsp; decades for that classification to be undone,&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks to a psychiatrist in&nbsp; disguise. Teen Shan, let ’em know. The year was 1972. Members of the American&nbsp; Psychiatric Association had gathered for their&nbsp;&nbsp; annual conference in Dallas, Texas. Several&nbsp; people sat on a panel about psychiatry and&nbsp;&nbsp; homosexuality… including someone wearing a&nbsp; costume and a Richard Nixon mask: Dr. Anonymous. “I am a homosexual,” he said into a microphone&nbsp; that distorted his voice. “I am a psychiatrist.”&nbsp; Leading up to the conference, lesbian&nbsp; activists Kay Tobin Lahusen and Barbara&nbsp;&nbsp; Gittings had searched endlessly&nbsp; for a gay psychiatrist who’d be&nbsp;&nbsp; willing to speak on the panel to help&nbsp; destigmatize their own sexuality. But doing so could jeopardize their&nbsp; careers, so many turned them down. Except for Dr. John Fryer, a gay psychiatrist&nbsp;&nbsp; who had lost a residency position&nbsp; because of his sexual orientation. He agreed to be the voice of gay psychiatrists&nbsp; on the panel—if he could protect his identity. During his speech, he spoke directly to&nbsp; the closeted psychiatrists in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp; saying that though coming&nbsp; out would be risky, quote, “We are taking an even bigger risk …&nbsp; not accepting fully our own humanity,&nbsp;&nbsp; with all the lessons it has to teach&nbsp; all the other humans around us.” His speech made an impact: the following year,&nbsp;&nbsp; homosexuality was removed as&nbsp; a mental illness from the DSM. And twenty years later, Dr. Fryer&nbsp; revealed himself as Dr. Anonymous. So homosexuality is not a mental illness. But that still doesn’t answer our big&nbsp; question: why do we like who we like? Is it because we’re born this way? Is there a&nbsp; code in my DNA that made me so boy-obsessed? Well, it’s not as simple as that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but scientists have found evidence that DNA&nbsp; and sexual orientation seem to be related. They can’t say that DNA causes&nbsp; anyone to be gay, straight,&nbsp;&nbsp; or anything else — but some studies have&nbsp; found evidence that there is a connection. Like, studies that followed identical&nbsp; twins found that if one twin was gay,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a small, increased likelihood&nbsp; that the other twin was as well. And big picture, a 2019 study&nbsp; found that hundreds or even&nbsp;&nbsp; thousands of genes may contribute&nbsp; to a person’s sexual orientation,&nbsp;&nbsp; and which of those genes gets turned on or off is&nbsp; probably strongly influenced by internal factors,&nbsp;&nbsp; like hormones we’re exposed to — not just&nbsp; in the womb, but also later during puberty. So, biology might be part of the story. But it’s&nbsp;&nbsp; also more complicated than&nbsp; Lady Gaga’s “born this way.” One thing we know thanks to sexological&nbsp; research is that who we’re attracted to&nbsp;&nbsp; isn’t always fixed: It can change&nbsp; and shift throughout our lives. This is called sexual fluidity, and it means&nbsp; that if you’re attracted to one gender now,&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn’t mean you could never be&nbsp; attracted to another gender in the future. And surveys have found that those shifts&nbsp; might happen for various personal,&nbsp;&nbsp; social, or environmental reasons&nbsp; that aren’t related to genetics. That said, evidence shows that sexual&nbsp; orientation can’t be forcibly changed. Notably, thousands of young LGBTQ+ people&nbsp; have undergone conversion therapy:&nbsp;&nbsp; treatments to try and make them heterosexual. This can involve medication, talk&nbsp; therapy, humiliation, and much more. But conversion therapy has been renounced by a long list&nbsp; of medical and psychotherapy associations,&nbsp;&nbsp; including the American Psychiatric Association and&nbsp;&nbsp; the American Medical Association —&nbsp; not only because it’s ineffective,&nbsp;&nbsp; but because multiple studies have found that&nbsp; it’s associated with mental health risks. Ultimately, why we like who we like is&nbsp; complicated. Throughout the centuries,&nbsp;&nbsp; the way some societies have viewed&nbsp; sexual orientation has changed. And so have the ways people have talked about it. Which brings us back to that big&nbsp; ol’ acronym from the beginning. It started with LG — the lesbian and gay&nbsp; community — but has expanded over the years,&nbsp;&nbsp; with different identities being acknowledged. The B stands for bisexual. Teen Shan: I know what that means.&nbsp; It’s being attracted to girls and guys. Shan: Well, yes and no. Some people see it that way, but others see&nbsp; bisexuality as encompassing more than the&nbsp;&nbsp; gender binary, including attraction&nbsp; to nonbinary and trans people. And other folks choose to identify as pan- or&nbsp; omnisexual, “pan” and “omni” meaning “all.” The T and I are for “transgender” and&nbsp; “intersex"", which we&nbsp; talked about in episode 4. The Q has two meanings: “questioning,”&nbsp; which helps those who may not be sure&nbsp;&nbsp; of their sexualities feel welcome in the group. And “queer,” which is often used today as&nbsp; an umbrella term for the whole community,&nbsp;&nbsp; or as a way of not strictly labeling&nbsp; someone’s sexual orientation. Teen Shan: Uh, Shan… even I know&nbsp; that word’s not cool to say. Shan: Well, good point— “queer” has&nbsp; been used as a slur in the past,&nbsp;&nbsp; though today, many in the community have&nbsp; reclaimed it as a term for self-identity. But that isn’t true everywhere,&nbsp;&nbsp; so be careful about using the term, especially&nbsp; if you don’t identify that way yourself. The A stands for asexual. This&nbsp; term encompasses the ace spectrum,&nbsp;&nbsp; people who experience low or no sexual attraction. For example, demisexual people&nbsp; only experience sexual attraction&nbsp;&nbsp; if they’re already very close with a person. And finally, you’ve got the plus, which&nbsp; includes all the many additional sexual&nbsp;&nbsp; orientations people experience, and&nbsp; the words they use to describe them. Now, this acronym isn’t perfect.&nbsp; Some folks think it’s too clunky,&nbsp;&nbsp; or that it normalizes straightness by lumping&nbsp; all the “other” people into one big group. But lots of people find it useful for&nbsp; building community, especially when&nbsp;&nbsp; they’re fighting oppression and injustice&nbsp; against different marginalized identities. As for how many people are in this big ol’ group?&nbsp; As of 2021, based on census data, the Human Rights&nbsp;&nbsp; Campaign estimated that there may be as many as 20&nbsp; million LGBTQ+ adults in the United States alone. So yeah, that’s why pride parades are so lit. In the end, we might not know exactly why we’re&nbsp; into the people we’re into — but as a society,&nbsp;&nbsp; we’ve definitely decided that it matters. Once,&nbsp;people wrote the story that being anything other than straight is wrong, and today,&nbsp; many others are working hard to unwrite it. Because variation in sexual orientation&nbsp; and behavior has always been around.&nbsp;&nbsp; And our understanding of it will just&nbsp; keep on growing and evolving as we do. Next time, we’re asking another big question:&nbsp; is virginity even a thing? We’ll see you then.

Who you know yourself to be on the inside doesn’t&nbsp; match who people assume you are from the outside. What steps would you take to fix that? Would&nbsp; you change your name? Your clothes? Your body? And which of those steps would be&nbsp; the one that made you feel like… you? That’s the experience for many&nbsp; transgender people—who are assigned&nbsp;&nbsp; a gender at birth that’s different&nbsp; from the way they know themselves. So let’s talk about what it&nbsp; really means to transition. Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and&nbsp; this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] No matter what color confetti&nbsp; exploded at their gender reveal party,&nbsp;&nbsp; someone’s genitals aren’t their&nbsp; destiny. They’re also not their&nbsp;&nbsp; gender —the socially constructed roles&nbsp; and behaviors often expected of us. And genitals aren’t even&nbsp; the end-all, be-all of sex,&nbsp;&nbsp; a classification based on physical traits that&nbsp; involves genitals, but also hormones and genes. Sex is often treated like a fork in the road:&nbsp; male or female, penis or vagina. But in reality,&nbsp;&nbsp; the possibilities look a lot more&nbsp; like a New York City subway map. So, let’s take a look at the map! The egg and the sperm that made you went&nbsp; halfsies on all your chromosomes, the bundles&nbsp;&nbsp; of DNA that make you you. And it’s mainly the 23rd&nbsp; chromosome pair that affects your sex development. From the egg, you get an X&nbsp; chromosome. And from the sperm,&nbsp;&nbsp; you usually get either another X,&nbsp; making you XX. Or a Y, making you XY. At about six weeks, an XX embryo usually&nbsp; starts developing what doctors would&nbsp;&nbsp; consider female reproductive organs: ovaries,&nbsp; fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina. And an XY embryo usually has a gene that turns on&nbsp; like: “grow a pair.” The embryo develops testes,&nbsp;&nbsp; those testes start secreting testosterone,&nbsp; and voila, more male reproductive organs:&nbsp;&nbsp; a prostate and a penis. There’s a whole lot more on&nbsp; how all this works in Crash Course Biology. Notice how I keep saying usually? That’s&nbsp; because some people are born intersex:&nbsp;&nbsp; with a blend of male and female traits, because&nbsp; of differences in their chromosomes or hormones. Like, an XX person might have testes, because&nbsp; the “grow a pair” gene that’s usually on the Y&nbsp;&nbsp; was on the X instead. Or an XY person might&nbsp; produce the usual levels of testosterone,&nbsp;&nbsp; but have hormone receptors that don’t&nbsp; respond to it with typical male development. There are a lot of different ways someone&nbsp; can be intersex! And those paths are more&nbsp;&nbsp; common than you think—about seventeen&nbsp; in every thousand people are born intersex. With about eight billion&nbsp; people on the planet in 2024,&nbsp;that’s— carry the two—yeah, 136 million people. Teen Shan: Wow, that’s more than&nbsp; three times the population of Canada! Wild, huh? But because there’s this expectation that&nbsp; everybody’s got either a penis or a vagina,&nbsp;&nbsp; intersex people are often put through&nbsp; medically unnecessary surgeries when&nbsp;&nbsp; they’re very young so their bodies&nbsp; look closer to what’s deemed “normal.” In any case, sex is only about the body you’re&nbsp; born with, not the person you become. It’s&nbsp;&nbsp; mostly about the “bits.” But as a society, you&nbsp; might say we’re committed to the bits. We use people’s anatomy to make assumptions about what&nbsp; they’re like, or how they’re supposed to act. And all those socially constructed&nbsp; ideas swirling around us? That’s gender. And gender identity is your&nbsp; inner sense of who you are,&nbsp;&nbsp; which could be a man, a woman,&nbsp; a blend of both, or neither. If you’re cisgender, your sex, your gender&nbsp; identity, and the gender assigned to you&nbsp;&nbsp; at birth are the same. But for everyone&nbsp; else, things aren’t so straightforward. A transgender person’s gender&nbsp; identity doesn’t match the gender&nbsp;&nbsp; they were assigned at birth based on their sex. For example, they were assigned male&nbsp; but identify as a girl. And a nonbinary&nbsp;&nbsp; person’s gender identity doesn’t&nbsp; fit neatly into either of the boxes,&nbsp;&nbsp; so they opt out of the gender binary altogether. Many nonbinary people also identify as&nbsp; transgender, but that’s up to the individual. For some folks, it takes years—or even decades—to&nbsp; recognize and put a name to those feelings. But for many, gender identity&nbsp; starts forming from an early age. I have a three-year-old who’s very&nbsp; curious about anatomy and gender,&nbsp;&nbsp; so this conversation comes up a lot in my house. Which is typical, because by three or four,&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s common for both cis and trans kids&nbsp; to say “I’m a girl” or “I’m a boy,” and to&nbsp;&nbsp; prefer same-gender friends, plus clothes&nbsp; and toys stereotypical for their gender. So even if a trans girl assigned&nbsp; “male” at birth is treated like a boy,&nbsp;&nbsp; she’s still developing an inner sense of “girl.”&nbsp; She’s paying close attention to social messages&nbsp;&nbsp; about what girls like and what girls do: messages&nbsp; like “only girls wear dresses and love pink.” But especially if you’re more of a jumpsuit&nbsp; gal, or a guy who rocks pink nail polish,&nbsp;&nbsp; you’ll know that that message—“only&nbsp; girls wear dresses and love pink”—is&nbsp;&nbsp; not an objective statement of&nbsp; reality. It’s a gender norm:&nbsp;&nbsp; a socially constructed idea about how people&nbsp; of different genders should look and act. Gender norms are everywhere, and they can be&nbsp; strong. A norm can feel as unquestionable as&nbsp;&nbsp; gravity, even if it’s just a thing people&nbsp; made up in a certain time and place. Like, during the 19th century, dresses were&nbsp; for anybody under the age of six. See this cutie in a little sundress? That’s&nbsp; future President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Even the idea that there are&nbsp; only two genders — also known&nbsp;&nbsp; as a gender binary — is a norm&nbsp; that not every culture co-signs. Many Native American tribes have traditionally&nbsp; recognized a third gender, often known by the&nbsp;&nbsp; pan-tribal term “Two-Spirit,” for people&nbsp; who embody both male and female qualities. Many Pacific Islander cultures also&nbsp; recognize a third gender—like the Māhū&nbsp;&nbsp; in Native Hawaiian tradition,&nbsp; meaning “the in-between.” And in Sāmoa, third and fourth gender people&nbsp; called fa‘afafine and fa’atama have the special&nbsp;&nbsp; role as a family caregiver, including being&nbsp; someone who can educate others about sex,&nbsp;&nbsp; a topic considered taboo for men&nbsp; and women to discuss publicly. If the idea that there are only two genders feels&nbsp; “normal” or “natural,” it might be because that&nbsp;&nbsp; idea was deliberately spread for centuries through&nbsp; the world’s worst road trip: European colonialism. While seizing peoples’ land, colonizers&nbsp; often suppressed and punished those who&nbsp;&nbsp; didn’t align with the two genders&nbsp; Europeans thought were correct. So the idea that there are only two genders is&nbsp; just that—an idea that people created to organize&nbsp;&nbsp; the world around them. But while putting stuff&nbsp; in boxes is great when you’re moving and have&nbsp;&nbsp; to separate your nightstand necessities from your&nbsp; kitchenware, it usually doesn’t work for people. So what happens when the box you’re put into&nbsp; doesn’t match who you are on the inside? Some people act on that feeling by going&nbsp; through a gender transition—choosing&nbsp;&nbsp; to live according to their gender&nbsp; identity—which can look like many things. For some, transitioning might look like&nbsp; changing their name or pronouns. For others,&nbsp;&nbsp; it might mean switching up their hair,&nbsp; their clothes, the way they talk. [Ash Perez] “I’m Ashly Perez, and I’m&nbsp; a hunky dude. And I’m 1 day on T.” “I’m Ashly Perez, and I’m a hunky&nbsp; dude. And I’m 16 weeks on T.” [Shan] And some transgender&nbsp; people—but not all—might&nbsp;&nbsp; choose to transition by making&nbsp; physical changes to their body. One pathway for that is gender affirming hormone therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This might involve things like testosterone or&nbsp; estrogen shots, which trigger physical changes&nbsp;&nbsp; similar to puberty, so that someone’s body changes&nbsp; to be more in line with their gender identity. Hormone replacement therapy is generally&nbsp; only prescribed to people over eighteen—or&nbsp;&nbsp; occasionally, someone in their late teens&nbsp; who has identified as trans for years,&nbsp;&nbsp; with approval from a doctor and their parents. As for young kids? Before puberty, a trans&nbsp; kid’s transition is primarily social,&nbsp;&nbsp; including things like their name,&nbsp; their pronouns, and their style. However, as puberty approaches,&nbsp; some trans kids might be prescribed&nbsp;&nbsp; a different kind of hormone therapy&nbsp; medication, called puberty blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp; medications that pause the changes&nbsp; that don’t align with their gender&nbsp;&nbsp; identity — things like facial hair,&nbsp; breast development, or a deeper voice. Puberty blockers have been tested and used&nbsp; safely for decades. And their effects are&nbsp;&nbsp; temporary—as soon as someone stops&nbsp; taking them, puberty revs up again. Finally, for some people, transitioning&nbsp; can involve surgery to their face or body,&nbsp;&nbsp; to create more masculine or feminine features&nbsp; that better align with their gender identity. You might hear this called&nbsp; “top” or “bottom” surgery,&nbsp;&nbsp; when it involves operating on&nbsp; someone’s chest or genitals. These surgeries have been done on people&nbsp; of all genders safely for decades — like&nbsp;&nbsp; how a cisgender woman might get breast&nbsp; reconstruction surgery after a mastectomy. And although there’s a common&nbsp; myth that trans people often&nbsp;&nbsp; regret getting gender-affirming surgery,&nbsp; research has shown that it’s very rare. All of these interventions fall under a holistic&nbsp; healthcare approach called gender-affirming care,&nbsp;&nbsp; which helps folks align their outward&nbsp; traits with their inner identity. In the vast majority of cases, gender-affirming&nbsp; care is safe, and it’s backed by decades of&nbsp;&nbsp; research and by almost every major&nbsp; medical organization in the U.S.,&nbsp;&nbsp; including the American Medical Association&nbsp; and the American Psychological Association. Gender-affirming care can also be life-saving,&nbsp; since it can help with the distress many trans and&nbsp;&nbsp; nonbinary people feel over the mismatch between&nbsp; their actual gender and their assigned one. That’s called gender dysphoria,&nbsp; and when it’s not addressed,&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s associated with higher-than-average&nbsp; rates of mental health conditions and suicide. That said, receiving support and appropriate&nbsp; medical care can mitigate these risks,&nbsp;&nbsp; which suggests that the problem&nbsp; isn’t being trans—it’s someone&nbsp;&nbsp; not being able to live out their gender identity. So there’s no “one size fits all”&nbsp; way to transition. For some people,&nbsp;&nbsp; gender-affirming care simply&nbsp; means talking to a therapist&nbsp;&nbsp; as they navigate transitioning&nbsp; in social, non-medical ways. Trans people have always been&nbsp; around, and always will be. What’s changing is how familiar&nbsp; people are with various gender&nbsp;&nbsp; identities and terms, how governments&nbsp; are collecting data about trans folks,&nbsp;&nbsp; and how easily people can connect&nbsp; to others with similar identities. That said, in the U.S., we haven’t&nbsp; exactly arrived at the peak of&nbsp;&nbsp; empathy and celebrating diverse gender identities. In 2023 alone, U.S. state legislators proposed—and&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes passed—over five hundred&nbsp; anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ laws. But the more accurate information&nbsp; is out there, the easier it is to&nbsp;&nbsp; base laws and policies on science and&nbsp; the lived experiences of trans people. And of course, honoring someone's gender identity&nbsp;&nbsp; by using the name and pronouns they&nbsp; choose makes a real difference, too. That word “transition” might sound like a&nbsp; moment [snaps] when somebody becomes who they are. But transitioning looks different&nbsp; for everyone. It can be messy,&nbsp;&nbsp; awkward, and meandering. Just&nbsp; like gender is for a lot of us. Because how people experience sex and gender&nbsp; is way more dynamic than a couple of boxes. Next time, we’ll talk about sexual orientation—or&nbsp; why we like who we like. See you then.

Personally I don’t have one, but this&nbsp; question—and others like it—have put&nbsp;&nbsp; penises in the spotlight since… well,&nbsp; before spotlights were even invented. Ancient civilizations idolized&nbsp; them. Early Christians hid them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin Klein ads flaunt them. But when&nbsp; you turn a body part into a symbol,&nbsp;&nbsp; you risk missing out on some&nbsp; pretty crucial information. So what’s the real deal with penises? Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and&nbsp; this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] Imagine you’re at a massive parade.&nbsp; We’re talking floats, marching bands. And at the end of the procession is&nbsp; the part we’ve all been waiting for:&nbsp;&nbsp; the arrival of a giant, golden penis? This was the vibe of festivals in&nbsp; ancient Greece that honored the&nbsp;&nbsp; wine god Dionysus. Greeks across the&nbsp; Athens-metropolitan-area celebrated&nbsp;&nbsp; this symbol of fertility with a&nbsp; one-night-only hookup extravaganza. And they weren’t the only&nbsp; ones to celebrate penises. The ancient Egyptians carved their&nbsp; gods with larger-than-life erections&nbsp;&nbsp; to represent creation. And&nbsp; the ancient Romans believed&nbsp;&nbsp; a phallus could ward off the “evil eye,”&nbsp; so they put them on all sorts of things. Kinda like me and Frank’s RedHot sauce. But when Christianity took hold over&nbsp; much of the world, the vibe changed,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it became more common to see the penis&nbsp; as a symbol of evil and sin. In the 1560s,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Council of Trent launched a campaign&nbsp; to cover up penises with fig leaves. And many women who were accused of witchcraft&nbsp; were actually accused of penis-stealing,&nbsp;&nbsp; or having “knowledge of the devil’s penis.” Hate em or love em, the theme was&nbsp; the same: Penises were a big deal. And to some degree, I totally get it.&nbsp; I think penises are fascinating! Like, it can just get erect without you telling it to. If you have a penis, you might’ve had&nbsp; your first erection before you were born,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you could have your last after you die. You don’t see that happen in zombie movies. But if we just think of penises as a symbol&nbsp; of celebration or sin, we’re missing out on&nbsp;&nbsp; learning about actual penises, which are pretty&nbsp; amazing. Just not in the parade float kinda way. Unlike the vulva and vagina, we’ve known&nbsp; how penises work for a long time. At least,&nbsp;&nbsp; once we got past the idea that&nbsp; erect penises were just full of air. Early thinkers were pretty fascinated&nbsp; by the D, including Leonardo da Vinci. Near the end of the 15th century,&nbsp; he dissected human cadavers and drew&nbsp;&nbsp; elaborate sketches of the penis structure,&nbsp; becoming the first to note that erections&nbsp;&nbsp; are not caused by air, but by&nbsp; increased blood flow to the penis. And since da Vinci’s day, our knowledge of the&nbsp; penis has… kept on growing. So let’s get into it. While the vulva has different holes&nbsp; for peeing and sex, the penis has&nbsp;&nbsp; just one small hole at the end of it. It’s&nbsp; called the meatus (nope, I am not joking),&nbsp;&nbsp; and it’s the exit for both urine and semen—the&nbsp; fluid that comes out when a person ejaculates. While pee has a relatively straight&nbsp; shot from the bladder out of the body,&nbsp;&nbsp; semen takes… more of a scenic route. After being formed in the testicles, mature&nbsp; sperm travels from a duct called the epididymis&nbsp;&nbsp; through a crazy-straw looking tube called&nbsp; the vas deferens, and eventually into&nbsp;&nbsp; another tube called the urethra, before it’s&nbsp; shot out from the meatus during ejaculation. And if the penis pulling&nbsp; double-duty makes you think,&nbsp;&nbsp; “Uh, Shan, doesn’t that mean I&nbsp; might pee during sex?” Don’t worry. During arousal, the muscles in the&nbsp; internal urethral sphincter contract,&nbsp;&nbsp; presumably to keep that very thing from happening. Now, as for semen — you might&nbsp; assume it’s mostly made of sperm,&nbsp;&nbsp; but sperm is only two to five&nbsp; percent of total semen volume. The rest is its entourage of nutrients&nbsp; and carrier liquid that keep the sperm&nbsp;&nbsp; alive and wriggling, and help defend them&nbsp; against the natural acidity of the vagina. For a full anatomy lesson, you can check&nbsp; out Crash Course Anatomy &amp; Physiology. But even if you can label a penis diagram&nbsp; with your eyes closed, there’s more to it&nbsp;&nbsp; than just the bits and bobs. So, let’s grab&nbsp; some questions from the Intimate Inbox. Oh here’s a good one… “Why do I get&nbsp; an erection while I’m sleeping?” Right, so, the penis is mostly&nbsp; made of a specialized kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; tissue with tons of tiny blood vessels in it. When blood flow increases, the penis swells, just&nbsp; like how a sponge swells when it's full of water. And while this increase in blood&nbsp; flow can happen when you’re aroused,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can also happen for seemingly no reason&nbsp; at all, including when you’re asleep. Overnight, your body regulates itself&nbsp; and its blood flow. Other than that,&nbsp;&nbsp; researchers still don’t fully understand why&nbsp; erections happen during sleep — or how often. Alright, let’s see if I have another one here… “Is it possible to break my penis? I’m&nbsp; SO SCARED of breaking my penis.” Well, I have some great news for you.&nbsp; Even though we use the word “boner”&nbsp;&nbsp; to refer to an erect penis, the human&nbsp; penis doesn’t actually have any bones. That said, if a penis is forcefully bent while&nbsp; it’s erect, the spongy tissue can rupture&nbsp;&nbsp; and tear, which can cause lots of pain&nbsp; and needs immediate medical attention. This is called a penis fracture, but I&nbsp; can’t stress enough that this is not a&nbsp;&nbsp; common outcome of sex or masturbation, so it’s&nbsp; not something to lose sleep, or pleasure, over. Okay, here’s a question from a non-penis-haver.&nbsp; “When I don’t want to have sex after making out,&nbsp;&nbsp; my boyfriend says he has blue&nbsp; balls. What does that mean?” I’m so glad you asked this question.&nbsp; The penis isn’t the only organ that&nbsp;&nbsp; can swell during arousal. Blood flow to&nbsp; the entire genital area is increased,&nbsp;&nbsp; including to the testicles, to&nbsp; help move semen to the urethra. So if someone gets aroused but doesn’t ejaculate,&nbsp; it can cause a temporary buildup of blood in the&nbsp;&nbsp; testicles, which can feel uncomfortable. Fun&nbsp; fact: the same thing goes for the clitoris! But unless that erection lasts for more&nbsp; than four hours, which actually is a&nbsp;&nbsp; sign of a medical condition, “blue&nbsp; balls” aren’t in any way dangerous. Ejaculating or just waiting for the&nbsp; arousal to subside will bring relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if your partner has blue balls, that&nbsp; isn’t something you have to help them with. Ok. [Shan rustling papers] Well, it looks like all the other questions&nbsp;&nbsp; in here are all just the same&nbsp; question: “Is my penis normal?” And the short answer to that is… probably?&nbsp; I mean, I’m not a doctor. But probably! If it ever feels like people make a huge&nbsp; deal out of penis size, you’re right. In general, Western societies have tended to&nbsp; associate bigger penises with masculinity,&nbsp;&nbsp; fertility, wealth, confidence — all sorts of&nbsp; things that have nothing to do with the actual&nbsp;&nbsp; size of someone’s genitals, but can do a great job&nbsp; at making someone feel insecure about themselves. Again with the useless symbolism! So let’s cut to the chase. The best&nbsp; estimates we have for average penis&nbsp;&nbsp; size come from a 2023 paper that analyzed&nbsp; seventy-five studies and included over&nbsp;&nbsp; fifty-five thousand measurements from&nbsp; different populations around the world. These were the results: an average flaccid length&nbsp;&nbsp; of 3.4 inches and an average&nbsp; erect length of 5.5 inches. As for girth, or circumference,&nbsp; another large study found an average&nbsp;&nbsp; flaccid girth of 3.7 inches, and an&nbsp; average erect girth of 4.6 inches. Before you whip out the measuring tape, here’s&nbsp; the thing: an average is just an average. There’s a significant range on either side of that&nbsp; middle number that’s considered “normal.” Plus, research shows that folks with penises are&nbsp; the ones who assign size the most importance. One study showed that eight-five percent of&nbsp; women were satisfied with the size of their&nbsp;&nbsp; partner’s penis, while only fifty-five percent&nbsp; of men were happy with what they had goin’ on. And in most cases, penis size is&nbsp; pretty unrelated to sexual performance. Outside of size, there’s a lot of variation&nbsp; to penises. Most are darker than the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp; the body and have one tone on the&nbsp; shaft and one tone on the head. Some have visible veins, and some penises are straight while others have a&nbsp; slight curve to them—up, down or to either side. And then there’s circumcision. You may&nbsp; have heard the words “cut” and “uncut”&nbsp;&nbsp; used to describe circumcised&nbsp; and uncircumcised penises. That’s because circumcision, typically&nbsp; performed at birth, is a surgery that&nbsp;&nbsp; removes the layer of skin covering the&nbsp; end of the penis, called the foreskin. Folks have been performing&nbsp; circumcisions since ancient times,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it’s arguably still the most&nbsp; common surgery performed today. Circumcision is chosen for all sorts&nbsp; of reasons, often as part of cultural&nbsp;&nbsp; or religious traditions. And it’s&nbsp; become the norm in some places,&nbsp;&nbsp; like the U.S. While it’s definitely not&nbsp; the norm in other places, like the UK. It’s hard to say exactly why this is, but it&nbsp; could’ve become cemented in the U.S. healthcare&nbsp;&nbsp; system and culture over time, possibly as a&nbsp; holdover from puritanical attitudes toward sex. Puritans used to see circumcision&nbsp; as a cure for masturbation,&nbsp;&nbsp; which they considered unhealthy and sinful. And you might be thinking, “But Shan, isn’t&nbsp; circumcision more hygienic?” Well, the jury’s out on that one. Most healthcare experts agree that&nbsp; there are some minimal benefits and some minimal&nbsp;&nbsp; risks associated with circumcision—not&nbsp; enough to firmly recommend either way. In either case, hygiene is a must. The best way&nbsp; to clean your penis is to pull back the foreskin&nbsp;&nbsp; all the way—if there is any—and wash thoroughly&nbsp; but gently with your fingers and warm water. You can also use a gentle, unscented soap. So there you have it. Penises might have been&nbsp; the stuff of legend for much of human history,&nbsp;&nbsp; but take away all the symbolism, and it turns out&nbsp; they’re just a really cool part of the human body. This is just the start of our foray into penises.&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ll be talking more about them—and&nbsp; other sex organs—in future episodes. Speaking of, next time, we’ll talk about&nbsp; what it means to transition. See you then.

Am I supposed to be shaving my pubic hair? These are just a few of the questions&nbsp; I hear every day as a sex educator. The vulva and the vagina can feel like they’re&nbsp; shrouded in mystery. So let’s change that! Because from the superstar clitoris to&nbsp; the billions of microorganisms hanging&nbsp;&nbsp; out in vaginas, there’s a whole lot&nbsp; of amazing stuff going on down there. Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and&nbsp; this is Crash Course Sex Ed. [THEME MUSIC] You know how when someone makes a penis&nbsp; joke, it’s usually lighthearted and funny,&nbsp; but then you go talking about vulvas and&nbsp; suddenly you’re getting a weird side eye? No? Just me? Here’s what I’m getting at: what’s considered&nbsp; “female anatomy” can be tangled up with shame. Take the word “pudendum.” It’s a medical&nbsp; term for genitals that usually refers to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Vulva &amp; Associates, and it comes from&nbsp; a Latin word that means “to be ashamed.” And that matters. Not just because we’re stigmatizing anatomy&nbsp; that roughly half the population has,&nbsp;&nbsp; but also because studies have shown that&nbsp; people who felt bad about their vulva and&nbsp;&nbsp; vagina were less likely to enjoy sex, or&nbsp; seek medical care when they needed it. This shame has also influenced how&nbsp; much we know about the vagina and co. Most of our modern understanding&nbsp; of sexual anatomy has been shaped&nbsp;&nbsp; by centuries of male-dominated thinking&nbsp; and research—much of which was conducted&nbsp;&nbsp; without the input of women, or&nbsp; anyone who wasn’t a cisgender man. Even a bunch of female organs are named after&nbsp; the male scientists who “discovered” them. Like,&nbsp;&nbsp; Fallopian tubes? Named after Gabriele&nbsp; Falloppio, who famously, didn’t have any. Here’s the deal, labias and genitals: the&nbsp; better we understand how all bodies work,&nbsp;&nbsp; the better off we are. So, let’s get into it. First things first: all this is not the vagina. Everything you can see from&nbsp; the outside is the vulva. The technical term for this area&nbsp; above the vulva is the mons pubis. These two outer lips are the labia majora. Then&nbsp;&nbsp; you have the inner lips—the labia&nbsp; minora—and within them, two holes. This teeny one at the end of the urethra is the&nbsp; urethral opening, which is where urine comes out,&nbsp;&nbsp; and this middle one down here is the vaginal&nbsp; opening, which is the doorway to the vagina. The vagina is that inner canal beyond the&nbsp; vaginal opening… and that’s it. Vulva, external; vagina, internal. When there’s nothing inside a vagina,&nbsp; it’s more of a flat envelope than a&nbsp;&nbsp; gaping tunnel. It’s an average&nbsp; of just over two inches long. But during arousal? It can expand&nbsp;&nbsp; up to eight inches… to make room for&nbsp; whatever it is you’ve got going on. Meanwhile, on the outside, the&nbsp; vulva extends all the way down here. This space of delicate tissue between the vaginal&nbsp; opening and the anus is called the perineum. You can learn more about these parts&nbsp; in Crash Course Anatomy &amp; Physiology. But for now, let me introduce you&nbsp; to this superstar: the clitoris. It’s tucked under the clittoral hood,&nbsp; but don’t let its size fool you. The part that we can see is&nbsp; just the tip of the iceberg. The clitoris is actually a large,&nbsp; complex structure that extends inside the pelvic cavity,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it’s made up of the same kind of&nbsp; spongy erectile tissue as the penis. Its full structure wasn’t uncovered&nbsp; until 2005—and this time, by a woman:&nbsp;&nbsp; Australian urologist Helen O’Connell. Keep in mind, the penis was fully&nbsp; anatomically described as early as 35 BCE,&nbsp;&nbsp; so the clitoris has been waiting&nbsp; a long time for the spotlight. The clitoris has over 10,000 nerve&nbsp; endings, and one of its main purposes&nbsp;&nbsp; is sexual pleasure, hence the superstar status. We’ll talk more about it in future episodes. But for now, let’s answer some questions&nbsp; from the Intimate Inbox. I’ll do the honors. Alright, the first question… “My&nbsp; vulva doesn’t look like the one&nbsp;&nbsp; on the poster in my health class.&nbsp; Is there something wrong with it?” You know what? Most people’s&nbsp; vulvas do not look like that. The inner lips can be longer than the outer lips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sets of labia can be&nbsp; different sizes or lengths. Your pubic hair can be bushy&nbsp; , wispy, curly, or straight. Your clitoris might be smaller or larger, and all of this diversity—as long as you’re&nbsp;&nbsp; not in pain or something’s affecting&nbsp; your quality of life—is normal. You might trim, shave, or wax your pubic hair&nbsp;&nbsp; for personal comfort or for&nbsp; intimacy, or you might not! There’s no right way to landscape your&nbsp; lawn, if you know what I’m saying. Alright, here’s another one. “Why is my&nbsp; skin down there darker than the rest of me?” That’s totally normal, too! Everyone’s skin has melanin in it,&nbsp; the pigment that gives skin its color. Around your genitals, these pigment-producing&nbsp; cells are super sensitive to hormones,&nbsp;&nbsp; and our hormones are really active in these areas. When the two interact, they create&nbsp; more pigment. Simple as that. “What’s with all the wetness?” You might have heard that when&nbsp; someone with a vulva gets aroused,&nbsp;&nbsp; they get “wet.” And that’s true! During sexual arousal more&nbsp; blood flows to the genital area. That makes these two little glands here and these&nbsp;&nbsp; two little glands here release fluid&nbsp; to lubricate the vaginal opening. Think of it as a natural lube.&nbsp; Fluid decreases friction,&nbsp;&nbsp; and just generally makes it easier for&nbsp; things to slide in and out of the vagina. But listen, vaginas get wet&nbsp; for all sorts of reasons. One of the most common ones? The big D: discharge. If you’ve ever looked in your&nbsp; underwear and been like, “Uhhhhh,&nbsp;&nbsp; what is that?” it’s probably discharge,&nbsp; which is the vagina’s wash cycle. The vagina cleans itself by shedding old cells,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it keeps the tissue healthy&nbsp; and protected with moisture. Vaginas produce around a half to a full&nbsp; teaspoon of discharge every day, but the&nbsp;&nbsp; fluid and the amount of it varies from person&nbsp; to person and throughout the menstrual cycle. Some of that discharge is from the&nbsp; glands we talked about earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp; but some is also produced by the cervix:&nbsp; where the vagina ends and the uterus begins. Really, though, the only time you&nbsp; should worry about discharge is&nbsp;&nbsp; if it’s different from your normal&nbsp; — like if it’s green-ish or foamy,&nbsp;&nbsp; has blood in it when it’s not&nbsp; your period, or smells off. In those cases, do consider&nbsp; talking to your doctor. “Sometimes my discharge smells…not&nbsp; bad, but kinda funky. Why is that?” Great question! To find out, let’s&nbsp; take a trip… inside the vagina. Believe it or not, everyone’s&nbsp; genitals are covered in microbes,&nbsp;&nbsp; including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. But&nbsp; don’t panic— that’s actually a good thing! The vagina is home to its own magnificent&nbsp; world of microorganisms, mostly bacteria,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they’re an essential part of&nbsp; keeping things safe and healthy. This invisible community is&nbsp; called the vaginal microbiome. Now, the research into all of this is pretty&nbsp; new, so there’s still a lot that we don’t know. And many studies have largely&nbsp; focused on white, Western women,&nbsp;&nbsp; though new research shows that the makeup of&nbsp; the vaginal microbiome varies by ethnicity. But here’s what we do know: The typical vaginal microbiome is mostly made&nbsp; up of a kind of bacteria called Lactobacillus. It’s the same genus of bacteria&nbsp; that’s found in yogurt and cheese,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it’s not the exact same species. These bacteria produce lactic acid,&nbsp;&nbsp; which keeps the vaginal environment&nbsp; on the acidic end of things. Now, if you’ve ever noticed that&nbsp; the crotch of your underwear&nbsp;&nbsp; wears out fast and gets bleached,&nbsp; that’s because of the lactic acid. The vagina is usually between&nbsp; a 3.8 and a 5 on the pH scale,&nbsp;&nbsp; which puts it somewhere between the&nbsp; acidity of wine vinegar and cucumbers. This keeps yeast and other kinds&nbsp; of local bacteria in check. Okay, back to the smell question.&nbsp; Everyone, especially people with vaginas,&nbsp;&nbsp; face a lot of social pressure&nbsp; to look and smell a certain way. How stuff smells down there depends&nbsp; on what’s going on with the vaginal&nbsp;&nbsp; microbiome, which is heavily affected by hormones. Both semen and menstrual blood can&nbsp; also throw off the vagina’s pH,&nbsp;&nbsp; because they’re more basic. Meaning “the opposite&nbsp; of acidic,” not like, pumpkin spice latte basic. That said, if things smell fishy down there?&nbsp;&nbsp; That could be a sign that the&nbsp; microbiome is out of balance. But here’s the great news: While vulvas benefit from a nice wash with&nbsp; warm water, vaginas are self-cleaning. You never need to use soap or any other&nbsp; kind of cleaning product inside your vagina. It’s cliterally bad for you, because your pH&nbsp; can be thrown off if you disturb it too much. And, when the microbiome is out of whack, that can&nbsp; lead to inflammation, discomfort, and pain. Overall, just like with discharge, the&nbsp; only time you should worry about how&nbsp;&nbsp; your vagina smells is if it’s&nbsp; different from your normal. Vulvas, vaginas, and everything that&nbsp; goes with them are pretty amazing. And they’re worth talking about and&nbsp; studying so that we can understand&nbsp;&nbsp; them just like any other part of the human body. And when it comes to what’s normal? If you have a vulva, the most important&nbsp; thing is learning what’s normal for you,&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep your body healthy,&nbsp; safe, and feelin’ in flow. Next time, we’re turning the&nbsp; spotlight on penises. See you then.

We’re all living evidence that sex happens,&nbsp; but what we think we know about it often comes&nbsp;&nbsp; from unreliable sources — and I don’t just&nbsp; mean your cousin’s best friend’s brother. As of 2022, only twenty-nine U.S. states&nbsp; required some kind of sex ed in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; And more than half of those didn’t require&nbsp; the information to be medically accurate. So let’s talk about it. Really talk. Hi, I’m Shan Boodram. I’m an AASECT-certified&nbsp; sex educator and an ABS-certified sexologist&nbsp;&nbsp; with a master’s in psychology. You might know me&nbsp; as the workshop teacher on “Too Hot to Handle.” I started learning and teaching&nbsp; people about intimacy because I&nbsp;&nbsp; was tired of how little information many&nbsp; people are given about their bodies and&nbsp;&nbsp; their human right to connect them with&nbsp; other enthusiastically consenting bodies. Like, in the fourth grade, an “expert” told&nbsp; my class that sex is when a man and a woman&nbsp;&nbsp; who love each other very much want to make&nbsp; a baby, so they hug each other very tightly. When I finally took sex ed into my&nbsp; hands via a library card at nineteen,&nbsp;&nbsp; I realized that not all sex&nbsp; education was created equal. And the sex ed that most people are&nbsp; subjected to, at least here in North America,&nbsp;&nbsp; has a lot in common with terrible sex. It’s dry,&nbsp;impersonal, and leaves you asking: is it over yet? Depending on where you live, sex ed can&nbsp; be woefully inadequate, if it even exists. Fewer than half of US states require that&nbsp; sex ed teaches students about contraception. And when it comes to LGBTQ+ people? Many sex&nbsp;ed programs either don’t talk about sexual orientation, or discriminate against anything&nbsp; other than traditional straight relationships. So, we here at Crash Course are&nbsp; making a different kind of sex ed. In fifteen episodes, we’ll meet the usual&nbsp; suspects: penises, vulvas, STIs, and pregnancy. But we’ll also be answering questions about&nbsp; orgasms, consent, and the millions of tiny&nbsp;&nbsp; organisms living in the vagina. We’ll also&nbsp;get real about masturbation and blue balls. And I promise, by the end, everyone&nbsp; will know where the clitoris is. But along the way, we’ll also talk about society,&nbsp;&nbsp; which influences what we think, what we&nbsp; do, and how we feel about getting it on. Why isn’t there a male birth control pill? What makes someone kinky? And is&nbsp; virginity really a thing? So whether you’re just dipping your toes&nbsp; into the sexual waters or you’ve been-there,&nbsp;&nbsp; done-that, we hope you’ll make Crash&nbsp; Course Sex Ed a part of your journey. This episode of Crash Course Sex Ed was produced&nbsp;&nbsp; in partnership with the Kinsey&nbsp; Institute at Indiana University. Thank you for watching this episode, which was&nbsp; filmed at our studio in Indianapolis and was&nbsp;&nbsp; made with the help of all these really&nbsp; nice people.
