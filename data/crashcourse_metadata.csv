But it could also lead us to something a lot darker. In order to prepare for that transition, we have to try and understand what it would really look like.

UFJQV5Jb0pY,The History of AI Explained: Crash Course Futures of AI #1,"In 1965, Moore’s Law predicted how computers would become smaller, faster, and more powerful than ever before. But here in 2025, we’re on the brink of an even bigger revolution. In this episode, we explore where AI's been, what it can do, and where it might be going. AI benchmarks and scaling laws help us understand what AI is, and could be, capable of. 

Introduction 00:00
How did AI get here? 2:21
How do we measure AI progress? 7:47
How can we predict the future of AI? 9:10
Conclusion 11:29

About This Series:
AI is changing FAST so rather than doing a full Crash Course series of 12+ episodes, we’ve prepared a mini-series of just the basics. Crash Course will never tell you what to think and we’re not the type of organization that responds to breaking news in real time. Instead, we’re here to offer a zoomed-out foundation upon which to base your own opinions as you continue to learn from other outlets about the world that’s changing around us.

Crash Course: Futures of AI will cover:
-What even is AI? What’s the history of this thing and how quickly has it evolved to what exists today?
-How could AI transform society? Will AI cause the next Industrial Revolution, and what might that mean for workers and the environment?
-How powerful could AI become? How do we measure the progression of AI? What are the consequences we’re already seeing, and what might be the future consequences of unchecked AI development?
-How might powerful AI cause harm? We’ll touch on copyright infringement, misinformation, surveillance, authoritarianism, and (unfortunately,) more. 
-How could AI be governed? What are the potential approaches for controlling AI both nationally and internationally?

P.S. Wondering if we used AI to create this series? Nope! Every Complexly video is lovingly, painstakingly human-made.

c7wCbbmLtiI,The Secret Language of Cults: Crash Course Lecture,"Words hold tremendous power. Cult leaders know that all too well — but so do fitness instructors, celebrities, and corporate leaders. In our world today, we are increasingly exposed to, and influenced by, complicated mazes of buzzwords, mantras, euphemisms, clichés, and redefinitions: in short, language that’s just a little bit cultish. Social commentator and author Amanda Montell presents this Crash Course lecture about linguistics, culture, and belonging. 

What’s a Crash Course Lecture?
While traditional Crash Courses on our channel break open an entire school subject, a Crash Course lecture tackles a single topic in-depth. Each lecture shares the perspective of a scholar, journalist, or thinker.

Introduction: A Story of Words 00:00
Cult-ish 1:22
Children of Synanon 3:33
The Cultish Past 7:22
The Cultish Present 12:55
Incantations 19:00
Eyes Wide Open 26:10
Under the Illusion 32:19
Exit Strategy 37:14
The Prestige 41:11

Over the course of 15 episodes, sexologist Shan Boodram will introduce you to the surprising, fascinating, wildly diverse, utterly normal realm of human sexuality. This series will explore the many dimensions of sex—from your body, to your personal identity, to the society around you—so you have the facts you need to make the right choices for you.

Course Description
In 15 episodes, sexologist Shan Boodram will teach you the ins and outs of sexual health. This series will explore sexual anatomy; identity and attraction; how society shapes our understanding of sexuality; and how to have safer sex.

- Reflect on the ways society shapes our understanding of sex, sexuality, and bodily autonomy
- Explain the functions of anatomy in terms of both reproduction and sexual response
 - Describe the differences between sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, and how our understanding of these aspects of identity continues to evolve 
- Think critically about how sexual consent is communicated
- Describe how unintended pregnancy and STIs can be prevented
- Explore how we identify ourselves and others as sexual beings

O77IFewBxcg,Crash Course Religions Preview,"Welcome to Crash Course Religions! Over the next 24 episodes, John Green will explore the history and culture of religions and how they offer frameworks for making sense of our lives — while being incredibly slippery things to pin down. We’ll discover how we define, debate, and contest what religion means, whether we’re personally religious or not. Episode 1 premieres on September 10, 2024.

This content is based on an introductory university-level curriculum and the input of an advisory board of religious scholars. By the end of this course, you should be able to: 

*Use tools and concepts in the study of religion to understand religious practices and worldviews.

*Unpack the history and culture of several major and minoritized religious traditions.

*Analyze inter-religious and intra-religious connections, influences, and frictions.

*Develop an informed historical perspective on contemporary religious issues and debates.

KXjxN3t_BNY,How Communities Make Art: Crash Course Art History #10,"Art is often understood as a solitary act of personal expression. But art is also the basis for community from Alaska to Mali — and from gay rights advocates to Frida Kahlo appreciators. In this episode we’ll learn how community is created through art.

Note: While Yayoi Kusama is an incredibly influential artist, she has a complicated legacy. Writer and PhD candidate Dexter Thomas has called attention to anti-Black racism in her published writing, including her 2002 autobiography “Infinity Net.” We encourage you to view Crash Course Art History Episode 5 to hear our discussion about artists with problematic histories and join the conversation.

Aa1dGBKgGVc,"Biological Diversity, Butts, and the Tree of Life: Crash Course Biology #18","Everywhere you look on Earth, you’ll find wonderful and diverse living things, from tiny tardigrades to soaring sequoias. And incredibly, everything alive today, and everything that’s ever lived, is related. In this episode of Crash Course Biology, we reveal how the evolutionary relationships between living things define their place on a single, great Tree of Life, and we learn what that tree can tell us about our own place among the planet’s biodiversity.

VmqZvlj07-w,Hurricane Katrina: Crash Course Black American History #49,"In this episode, Clint Smith details his experience as a teenager in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005. The widespread devastation of Hurricane Katrina was a result of faulty levees and a fumbled response by FEMA, and it hit Black residents the hardest. Today, we'll take a closer look at the structural racism that made this disaster so catastrophic.

t_uMce7lK94,Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas: Crash Course Black American History #46,"Today, Clint will teach you about the Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Clarence Thomas. During the screening process, Anita Hill came forward alleging that Thomas had sexually harassed her when the two of them worked together at the Department of Education. The public response to Hill's allegations was tense and split the Black American community along gendered lines. Thomas's nomination was ultimately confirmed by a margin of 52-48, and he became the second Black American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

prKS4YsSnmE,Los Angeles Uprisings: Crash Course Black American History #45,"In this episode of Black American History, Clint Smith teaches you about the complicated history of racial tension in South Central Los Angeles. You'll learn about the Watts Rebellion of 1965, a 6-day uprising in response to police brutality that shaped the landscape of racial tension in southern California for years to come. This tension culminated in two major events -- the murder of Latasha Harlins and the beating of Rodney King in 1991 -- which incited the L.A. Uprisings of 1992.

C2vl1mixqLU,Jesse Jackson: Crash Course Black American History #44,"Today, Clint Smith is teaching you about the Civil Rights activist and Icon, Reverend Jesse Jackson. Jackson began his career working with Martin Luther King in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he founded PUSH, an organization to advance the cause of urban, poor, and predominantly Black communities. Jackson ran for president of the United States in 1984 and 1988, and founded another organization, the Rainbow Coalition. Jackson has worked for decades for the cause of Civil Rights and his long career has served as a bridge from the work of the 1960s to the movement for Black lives today.

5aww-Bpgkf4,What is Public Health? Crash Course Public Health #1,"We often think of health as a self-centric phenomenon that begins and ends with ""me"", but as we'll explore throughout this series our personal health is just one plot line in a rich story of evolving research and policies that make up the world of public health. So what is public health anyway? Well, public health is an approach to preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health for literally everyone. It is a money-saving, life-extending, world-bettering cheat code for improving the world, so we'll spend the rest of this series examining how and where it is working, where it isn't working, and how so much of our health is influenced by the world around us.

ATfkyVN7M5c,Shirley Chisholm: Crash Course Black American History #43,"In 1972, Shirley Chisholm ran for president of the United States of America as a Democrat.

Today we'll learn about her life, her career, and her legacy.

PjdJ19ugXzQ,Crash Course Public Health Preview!,"Welcome to Crash Course Public Health! Over the next 10 episodes, Vanessa Hill unpacks what public health is, who does public health work, and why thinking about it is so important! Public Health is so much more than just washing your hands, adhering to smoking laws, or wearing your seatbelt -- although it is those things too. Broadly, public health is an approach to preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health for everyone. So over the course of this series, we'll show you the many ways the story of your health isn’t just about you, and how it’s about so much other stuff like the social, economic, and environmental conditions that impact all of us.

The end of college isn't the end of your education, it's just the end of a chapter of your education. But before we think about what comes next, we should really pause to celebrate. Congratulate ourselves. The work to get through higher ed is challenging. And it can be really helpful to use a celebration to close the book on it so you're ready to move on to the next chapter. In this final episode of How to College, we talk about the road ahead.

shGpC_WVDQk,The War on Drugs: Crash Course Black American History #42,"The War on Drugs is a decades-long United States policy intended to curb illegal drug use and trafficking. Long story short: it has not worked to reduce drug use or trade, and the policy has had devastating effects, especially on communities of color. Today we'll talk about the history of the War on Drugs, what it was trying to accomplish, and how it contributed to the US as a carceral state and the nation that imprisons more of its population than any country in the world.

ftcvaJCKVjs,Marsha P. Johnson and the Stonewall Rebellion: Crash Course Black American History #41,"Today we’re learning about Marsha P. Johnson and the Stonewall rebellion. Serving as a pivotal moment in the modern Gay Rights Movement, Stonewall began on June 28th, 1969, and lasted six days in New York City’s Greenwich Village. And even though the rebellion lasted less than a week, the reverberations lasted for generations. Out of Stonewall emerged the establishment of one of the first gay pride parades, increased activism and organizing on behalf of gay people, and greater attention paid to the rights and needs of LGBTQ+ communities.

8woU9Rq0cPI,Malcolm X and the Rise of Black Power: Crash Course Black American History #38,"In the late 1950s and the early to mid-1960s, a Muslim minister named Malcolm X rose to prominence in the United States during the struggle for Civil Rights. Malcolm X was a member of and spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, and he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment. His views differed significantly from a lot of the well-known Civil Rights activists of the day, and his views evolved during his ministry. Today, we’ll learn about Malcolm X’s origins, his work with the Nation of Islam, his break from that organization, and his eventual assassination.

qygFjt2_LG4,Medicinal Chemistry and Penicillin Total Synthesis: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #50,"These days, we don't have to worry too much about meeting an early demise from ulcers, breaks in the stomach lining that could be fatal back in the early 1900s. This is because we have medicines to treat them, like proton pump inhibitors! In this final episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we'll look at medicinal chemistry by breaking down how penicillin fights bacteria, how proteins are made both in the body and in the lab, and we'll finally finish our synthesis of penicillin V and complete our Mold Medicine Map! Hopefully this series has shown you the many ways organic chemistry is all around us and how it can help us to better understand ourselves, and improve our world!
