gt gt awesome. thank you both. um so, yeah, if gt gt awesome. thank you both. um so, yeah, if you i'm going to ask i'm going to ask a you i'm going to ask i'm going to ask a you i'm going to ask i'm going to ask a question for the chat first, but then i question for the chat first, but then i question for the chat first, but then i would love it if you both could tell us would love it if you both could tell us would love it if you both could tell us how a crash course script gets made. and how a crash course script gets made. and how a crash course script gets made. and for all of you watching at home, thank for all of you watching at home, thank for all of you watching at home, thank you for telling me where you're from. you for telling me where you're from. you for telling me where you're from. massachusetts girly. go birds. um, massachusetts girly. go birds. um, massachusetts girly. go birds. um, how many people do you think the average how many people do you think the average how many people do you think the average crash course script goes through before crash course script goes through before crash course script goes through before production we tend to talk about steps production we tend to talk about steps production we tend to talk about steps and there's pre-production, production, and there's pre-production, production, and there's pre-production, production, when it's filmed, and post-production. when it's filmed, and post-production. when it's filmed, and post-production. so, but within each of those steps, so, but within each of those steps, so, but within each of those steps, there's a lot going on. so, if you have there's a lot going on. so, if you have there's a lot going on. so, if you have any guesses about how many people you any guesses about how many people you any guesses about how many people you think the average crash grow script think the average crash grow script think the average crash grow script touches before it goes to be filmed with touches before it goes to be filmed with touches before it goes to be filmed with the host, go ahead and make your guesses the host, go ahead and make your guesses the host, go ahead and make your guesses in the chat and megan and annie will in the chat and megan and annie will in the chat and megan and annie will teach us that along the way. awesome. so, i'm going to talk a little awesome. so, i'm going to talk a little bit about what makes a crash course bit about what makes a crash course bit about what makes a crash course script. um, you know, what exactly is script. um, you know, what exactly is script. um, you know, what exactly is the special sauce of of a crash course the special sauce of of a crash course the special sauce of of a crash course script and, um, the first thing is that script and, um, the first thing is that script and, um, the first thing is that it needs to be accurate. um, anytime it needs to be accurate. um, anytime it needs to be accurate. um, anytime you're making educational materials or you're making educational materials or you're making educational materials or tools, that's the bottom line is that we tools, that's the bottom line is that we tools, that's the bottom line is that we have to be as accurate as possible. so, have to be as accurate as possible. so, have to be as accurate as possible. so, the crash course scripts go through lots the crash course scripts go through lots the crash course scripts go through lots of people to make sure that our scripts of people to make sure that our scripts of people to make sure that our scripts are as accurate as possible. we use um are as accurate as possible. we use um are as accurate as possible. we use um primary sources and peer-reviewed primary sources and peer-reviewed primary sources and peer-reviewed research. we have fact checkers, experts research. we have fact checkers, experts research. we have fact checkers, experts in the field. um, and we also share our in the field. um, and we also share our in the field. um, and we also share our sources for each of the videos in the sources for each of the videos in the sources for each of the videos in the description to make sure we're as description to make sure we're as description to make sure we're as transparent as possible. um, so that's transparent as possible. um, so that's transparent as possible. um, so that's like the main thing, but then also you like the main thing, but then also you like the main thing, but then also you might know that like we have a crown might know that like we have a crown might know that like we have a crown coursey tone and um that comes from coursey tone and um that comes from coursey tone and um that comes from trying to be clear, engaging, and trying to be clear, engaging, and trying to be clear, engaging, and inclusive. so we try to make our videos inclusive. so we try to make our videos inclusive. so we try to make our videos as accessible as possible and not use as accessible as possible and not use as accessible as possible and not use too much jargon, you know, define terms too much jargon, you know, define terms too much jargon, you know, define terms when we have them. um, but make sure when we have them. um, but make sure when we have them. um, but make sure it's like simple language that feels it's like simple language that feels it's like simple language that feels everyday and conversational and that is everyday and conversational and that is everyday and conversational and that is engaging in the way a conversation with engaging in the way a conversation with engaging in the way a conversation with a friend would be. we like to learn a friend would be. we like to learn a friend would be. we like to learn alongside the viewer rather than simply alongside the viewer rather than simply alongside the viewer rather than simply teach. um, and our videos also answer teach. um, and our videos also answer teach. um, and our videos also answer the so what. so, we talk about a lot in the so what. so, we talk about a lot in the so what. so, we talk about a lot in editorial spaces, which is we're editorial spaces, which is we're editorial spaces, which is we're learning something, but why does it learning something, but why does it learning something, but why does it matter why should the viewer care that matter why should the viewer care that matter why should the viewer care that u we're learning this information and u we're learning this information and u we're learning this information and that really guides and propels both the that really guides and propels both the that really guides and propels both the series and each individual script. series and each individual script. series and each individual script. um, and we also build around narrative. um, and we also build around narrative. um, and we also build around narrative. um, storytelling is really essential to um, storytelling is really essential to um, storytelling is really essential to crash course and it helps us remember crash course and it helps us remember crash course and it helps us remember the things we learn and put them into the things we learn and put them into the things we learn and put them into context with our daily lives. so, we'll context with our daily lives. so, we'll context with our daily lives. so, we'll talk much more about narrative in a talk much more about narrative in a talk much more about narrative in a second, but um, our next um, quality is second, but um, our next um, quality is second, but um, our next um, quality is that all our scripts are entirely that all our scripts are entirely that all our scripts are entirely original. we do not use ai in any of our original. we do not use ai in any of our original. we do not use ai in any of our creative work. um, and we make sure creative work. um, and we make sure creative work. um, and we make sure everything is crystal clear, not everything is crystal clear, not everything is crystal clear, not plagiarized. um any script you hear plagiarized. um any script you hear plagiarized. um any script you hear recited by the host has been um made by recited by the host has been um made by recited by the host has been um made by humans which we really pride ourselves humans which we really pride ourselves humans which we really pride ourselves in. um and our scripts also treat our in. um and our scripts also treat our in. um and our scripts also treat our audience with honesty, nuance and care. audience with honesty, nuance and care. audience with honesty, nuance and care. we want to really imagine that our we want to really imagine that our we want to really imagine that our audience are the complex people that audience are the complex people that audience are the complex people that they are and try to showcase stories um they are and try to showcase stories um they are and try to showcase stories um and also like hypothetical scenarios and also like hypothetical scenarios and also like hypothetical scenarios that feel like they represent a wide that feel like they represent a wide that feel like they represent a wide variety of people. and so how does this all start um once and so how does this all start um once we have a series green lit, the first we have a series green lit, the first we have a series green lit, the first step is to sort of envision what the step is to sort of envision what the step is to sort of envision what the series might look like. and so that series might look like. and so that series might look like. and so that starts with a brainstormed episode list. starts with a brainstormed episode list. starts with a brainstormed episode list. we often enlist the help of a subject we often enlist the help of a subject we often enlist the help of a subject matter expert who can help us figure out matter expert who can help us figure out matter expert who can help us figure out what do we want all the episodes to be what do we want all the episodes to be what do we want all the episodes to be about um how do we want to convey the about um how do we want to convey the about um how do we want to convey the information what are some possible information what are some possible information what are some possible hooks and stories that we could use to hooks and stories that we could use to hooks and stories that we could use to express that information and so this express that information and so this express that information and so this takes a bit of iteration trying to takes a bit of iteration trying to takes a bit of iteration trying to figure out, you know, how many episodes figure out, you know, how many episodes figure out, you know, how many episodes makes the most sense, what do we want to makes the most sense, what do we want to makes the most sense, what do we want to talk about in each one and sort of a lot talk about in each one and sort of a lot talk about in each one and sort of a lot of brainstorming happens at this stage. of brainstorming happens at this stage. of brainstorming happens at this stage. and after that, we create a syllabus. so and after that, we create a syllabus. so and after that, we create a syllabus. so if you've ever taken a college class, if you've ever taken a college class, if you've ever taken a college class, you know, the first day of class, your you know, the first day of class, your you know, the first day of class, your professor shows up and hands you a piece professor shows up and hands you a piece professor shows up and hands you a piece of paper that details what the whole of paper that details what the whole of paper that details what the whole course is going to cover. and that's course is going to cover. and that's course is going to cover. and that's what we use as sort of an internal guide what we use as sort of an internal guide what we use as sort of an internal guide for um our for our our videos um and to for um our for our our videos um and to for um our for our our videos um and to help our writers uh script their uh help our writers uh script their uh help our writers uh script their uh videos. so the syllabus is basically a videos. so the syllabus is basically a videos. so the syllabus is basically a really fleshed out episode list. we have really fleshed out episode list. we have really fleshed out episode list. we have things like the course description, the things like the course description, the things like the course description, the learning objectives, and then we break learning objectives, and then we break learning objectives, and then we break down each script um topic into subtopics down each script um topic into subtopics down each script um topic into subtopics and put in all of the actual concrete and put in all of the actual concrete and put in all of the actual concrete information that we want to convey. so, information that we want to convey. so, information that we want to convey. so, we'll have things like key terms, but we'll have things like key terms, but we'll have things like key terms, but also fun stuff like special segments or also fun stuff like special segments or also fun stuff like special segments or also misconceptions we want to make sure also misconceptions we want to make sure also misconceptions we want to make sure that we address or don't fall into. um, that we address or don't fall into. um, that we address or don't fall into. um, and then that is sort of the framework and then that is sort of the framework and then that is sort of the framework that the writer uses to create their that the writer uses to create their that the writer uses to create their first draft. first draft. first draft. and so that takes a lot of research on and so that takes a lot of research on and so that takes a lot of research on their part, looking through all of the their part, looking through all of the their part, looking through all of the uh sources that are linked in the uh sources that are linked in the uh sources that are linked in the syllabus and figuring out how to build a syllabus and figuring out how to build a syllabus and figuring out how to build a story around that information. and so story around that information. and so story around that information. and so after that it goes through many rounds after that it goes through many rounds after that it goes through many rounds of edits including through me through of edits including through me through of edits including through me through megan and eventually after going through megan and eventually after going through megan and eventually after going through a fact checker and a producer and the a fact checker and a producer and the a fact checker and a producer and the host it becomes a real actual video. um host it becomes a real actual video. um host it becomes a real actual video. um shout out to latin american literature shout out to latin american literature shout out to latin american literature which is airing now. which is airing now. which is airing now. okay so here's the answer to the okay so here's the answer to the okay so here's the answer to the question. a it does range, but somewhere question. a it does range, but somewhere question. a it does range, but somewhere around 8 to 10 plus people work on every around 8 to 10 plus people work on every around 8 to 10 plus people work on every crash course script. and that's just the crash course script. and that's just the crash course script. and that's just the script. you should more than double it script. you should more than double it script. you should more than double it once you start to get into the video once you start to get into the video once you start to get into the video elements and the animation elements. elements and the animation elements. elements and the animation elements. sometimes we have uh you know sometimes we have uh you know sometimes we have uh you know illustrator like for native american illustrator like for native american illustrator like for native american history, we have illustrators who are history, we have illustrators who are history, we have illustrators who are from indigenous cultures and things like from indigenous cultures and things like from indigenous cultures and things like that. and then that um that adds more that. and then that um that adds more that. and then that um that adds more and more collaborators which is is and more collaborators which is is and more collaborators which is is something that uh is so fun and and something that uh is so fun and and something that uh is so fun and and rewarding for us and we hope it is for rewarding for us and we hope it is for rewarding for us and we hope it is for the audience as well. um so i'm going to the audience as well. um so i'm going to the audience as well. um so i'm going to show you i know you can't see this. uh show you i know you can't see this. uh show you i know you can't see this. uh and i kind of wanted to show it to you and i kind of wanted to show it to you and i kind of wanted to show it to you this way just to emphasize like it this way just to emphasize like it this way just to emphasize like it doesn't fit on a slide. the crash course doesn't fit on a slide. the crash course doesn't fit on a slide. the crash course script process is so elaborate it script process is so elaborate it script process is so elaborate it doesn't really fit on a slide. but i am doesn't really fit on a slide. but i am doesn't really fit on a slide. but i am going to sort of um zoom in for you and going to sort of um zoom in for you and going to sort of um zoom in for you and show you a a high level of our full sort show you a a high level of our full sort show you a a high level of our full sort of flowchart of how a crash course of flowchart of how a crash course of flowchart of how a crash course script gets made. um so i'm going to try script gets made. um so i'm going to try script gets made. um so i'm going to try to zoom in. um basically we start once to zoom in. um basically we start once to zoom in. um basically we start once yeah like annie said once we decide to yeah like annie said once we decide to yeah like annie said once we decide to make a series the first thing we do is make a series the first thing we do is make a series the first thing we do is we hire a subject matter expert. that's we hire a subject matter expert. that's we hire a subject matter expert. that's going to take a few months. then we move going to take a few months. then we move going to take a few months. then we move into a sort of curriculum development into a sort of curriculum development into a sort of curriculum development phase. so, we're taking several weeks to phase. so, we're taking several weeks to phase. so, we're taking several weeks to develop an episode list, like a develop an episode list, like a develop an episode list, like a highlevel outline, like she talked highlevel outline, like she talked highlevel outline, like she talked about. then, we're taking several more about. then, we're taking several more about. then, we're taking several more weeks to fill out that outline with weeks to fill out that outline with weeks to fill out that outline with sources, with story ideas, etc. if we sources, with story ideas, etc. if we sources, with story ideas, etc. if we have a funding partner, of course, have a funding partner, of course, have a funding partner, of course, there's back and forth during that part. there's back and forth during that part. there's back and forth during that part. um, finally, once the syllabus is um, finally, once the syllabus is um, finally, once the syllabus is complete, we move into scripting. and i complete, we move into scripting. and i complete, we move into scripting. and i don't expect you i'm just sort of taking don't expect you i'm just sort of taking don't expect you i'm just sort of taking you through this just to give you a you through this just to give you a you through this just to give you a sense of the scope. obviously, there's sense of the scope. obviously, there's sense of the scope. obviously, there's not going to be a pop quiz at the end. not going to be a pop quiz at the end. not going to be a pop quiz at the end. um but yeah, then we move into a first um but yeah, then we move into a first um but yeah, then we move into a first draft. we have our subject matter expert draft. we have our subject matter expert draft. we have our subject matter expert review every single draft to make sure review every single draft to make sure review every single draft to make sure that we've gotten everything right at a that we've gotten everything right at a that we've gotten everything right at a high level. we have uh multiple edits. high level. we have uh multiple edits. high level. we have uh multiple edits. so first we have like a developmental so first we have like a developmental so first we have like a developmental edit which is more focused on story and edit which is more focused on story and edit which is more focused on story and priorities. you know, did we spend priorities. you know, did we spend priorities. you know, did we spend enough time on one thing and too much enough time on one thing and too much enough time on one thing and too much time on another thing things like that. time on another thing things like that. time on another thing things like that. then we have the the lead editor do a then we have the the lead editor do a then we have the the lead editor do a second edit. um and then uh things get second edit. um and then uh things get second edit. um and then uh things get passed to different types of passed to different types of passed to different types of

order guide that helps us keep things in order guide that helps us keep things in order um on our end. gt gt awesome. uh so yeah, big big picture we gt gt awesome. uh so yeah, big big picture we something we really think about when something we really think about when something we really think about when we're trying to figure out how to make we're trying to figure out how to make we're trying to figure out how to make it all a story. uh we ask ourselves the it all a story. uh we ask ourselves the it all a story. uh we ask ourselves the these three questions. what am i these three questions. what am i these three questions. what am i learning that i didn't know before learning that i didn't know before learning that i didn't know before what's making me feel something and what's making me feel something and what's making me feel something and what's my genuine journey of discovery what's my genuine journey of discovery what's my genuine journey of discovery um almost all of the time our writers um almost all of the time our writers um almost all of the time our writers are not experts on the subject. and so are not experts on the subject. and so are not experts on the subject. and so when we give them this these syllabi, when we give them this these syllabi, when we give them this these syllabi, they are genuinely reading information, they are genuinely reading information, they are genuinely reading information, digesting things, synthesizing digesting things, synthesizing digesting things, synthesizing information for the first time, learning information for the first time, learning information for the first time, learning a lot of things for the first time. and a lot of things for the first time. and a lot of things for the first time. and that means that we get frustrated that means that we get frustrated that means that we get frustrated sometimes. we get confused. we're sometimes. we get confused. we're sometimes. we get confused. we're grasping for like analogies and grasping for like analogies and grasping for like analogies and metaphors to try to latch on to metaphors to try to latch on to metaphors to try to latch on to something we already know. and then something we already know. and then something we already know. and then sometimes those fall apart and we have sometimes those fall apart and we have sometimes those fall apart and we have to start again. that whole process of to start again. that whole process of to start again. that whole process of learning um it happens to us and every learning um it happens to us and every learning um it happens to us and every time we try to write a crash course time we try to write a crash course time we try to write a crash course script and you know when you grow up script and you know when you grow up script and you know when you grow up when you go to school you learn to hide when you go to school you learn to hide when you go to school you learn to hide that whole part of the writing process that whole part of the writing process that whole part of the writing process and just document okay i've sorted it and just document okay i've sorted it and just document okay i've sorted it out and let me put the clean and out and let me put the clean and out and let me put the clean and finished part on the page but what we finished part on the page but what we finished part on the page but what we try to do is really hold on to what were try to do is really hold on to what were try to do is really hold on to what were the highs and lows of my journey to the highs and lows of my journey to the highs and lows of my journey to understanding this information what were understanding this information what were understanding this information what were the twists and turns the moments where i the twists and turns the moments where i the twists and turns the moments where i fell into a misconception or got fell into a misconception or got fell into a misconception or got confused and how did i sort of resolve confused and how did i sort of resolve confused and how did i sort of resolve that and we try to build a story from that and we try to build a story from that and we try to build a story from that. that. that. um, and i i think this is like an um, and i i think this is like an um, and i i think this is like an extremely nerdy thing to say, but i i extremely nerdy thing to say, but i i extremely nerdy thing to say, but i i think i can prove it to you. um that it think i can prove it to you. um that it think i can prove it to you. um that it it seems crazy to say that we would we it seems crazy to say that we would we it seems crazy to say that we would we take our journey of discovery and make take our journey of discovery and make take our journey of discovery and make it like a plot, but um i'm going to show it like a plot, but um i'm going to show it like a plot, but um i'm going to show you how we you can really layer a crash you how we you can really layer a crash you how we you can really layer a crash course script onto this is like a common course script onto this is like a common course script onto this is like a common plot structure. i pulled this from the plot structure. i pulled this from the plot structure. i pulled this from the legendary comedy training center upright legendary comedy training center upright legendary comedy training center upright citizens brigade. this is their um this citizens brigade. this is their um this citizens brigade. this is their um this is like an adapted version of their plot is like an adapted version of their plot is like an adapted version of their plot structure for like a tv show pilot, like structure for like a tv show pilot, like structure for like a tv show pilot, like a comedy tv show pilot. but i'm going to a comedy tv show pilot. but i'm going to a comedy tv show pilot. but i'm going to show you how um a crash course script show you how um a crash course script show you how um a crash course script defining and the nerdy concept of what defining and the nerdy concept of what defining and the nerdy concept of what is a species actually kind of fits into is a species actually kind of fits into is a species actually kind of fits into this tv pilot format. um so we'll start this tv pilot format. um so we'll start this tv pilot format. um so we'll start with fun. open with something fun, with fun. open with something fun, with fun. open with something fun, interesting, and relatable. so this is interesting, and relatable. so this is interesting, and relatable. so this is an example from a real crash course an example from a real crash course an example from a real crash course script. a sleepy bassad hound and a script. a sleepy bassad hound and a script. a sleepy bassad hound and a tireless border collie look and act like tireless border collie look and act like tireless border collie look and act like they're from different planets, but they they're from different planets, but they they're from different planets, but they can have a weird looking litter of can have a weird looking litter of can have a weird looking litter of puppies that can make more puppies. puppies that can make more puppies. puppies that can make more puppies. that's because they're the same species. that's because they're the same species. that's because they're the same species. but meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and but meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and but meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. but known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. but known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. but sadly, that source can't have more zorse sadly, that source can't have more zorse sadly, that source can't have more zorse babies because horses and zebras are babies because horses and zebras are babies because horses and zebras are different species. so okay, organis two different species. so okay, organis two different species. so okay, organis two organisms are considered members of the organisms are considered members of the organisms are considered members of the same species if they can mate and make same species if they can mate and make same species if they can mate and make fertile offspring. fertile offspring. fertile offspring. okay, but we encounter a frustration okay, but we encounter a frustration okay, but we encounter a frustration right off the bat. life has been known right off the bat. life has been known right off the bat. life has been known to break these rules. like there are to break these rules. like there are to break these rules. like there are some hybrids that can reproduce. you some hybrids that can reproduce. you some hybrids that can reproduce. you might know some of them without knowing might know some of them without knowing might know some of them without knowing you know them. like if you've ever had a you know them. like if you've ever had a you know them. like if you've ever had a plumcot from the grocery store, but plumcot from the grocery store, but plumcot from the grocery store, but there are also hybrid animals that can there are also hybrid animals that can there are also hybrid animals that can reproduce, including this hybrid lizard reproduce, including this hybrid lizard reproduce, including this hybrid lizard species. uh, and females actually don't species. uh, and females actually don't species. uh, and females actually don't even need a mate to do so. so, that even need a mate to do so. so, that even need a mate to do so. so, that completely breaks the definition of completely breaks the definition of completely breaks the definition of species that i just gave to you. we've species that i just gave to you. we've species that i just gave to you. we've hit a snag. we've hit our first conflict hit a snag. we've hit our first conflict hit a snag. we've hit our first conflict in our plot. in our plot. in our plot. okay. well, then the next the next part okay. well, then the next the next part okay. well, then the next the next part of the story structure is having a a new of the story structure is having a a new of the story structure is having a a new plan, a false victory. okay. so, because plan, a false victory. okay. so, because plan, a false victory. okay. so, because of exceptions like the plumcot and that of exceptions like the plumcot and that of exceptions like the plumcot and that lizard, uh, other scientists think it's lizard, uh, other scientists think it's lizard, uh, other scientists think it's better to define species by their better to define species by their better to define species by their genealogy. according to this idea, all genealogy. according to this idea, all genealogy. according to this idea, all organisms in the same evolutionary organisms in the same evolutionary organisms in the same evolutionary lineage are one species. lineage are one species. lineage are one species. oops. but that gets complicated for a oops. but that gets complicated for a oops. but that gets complicated for a bunch of reasons, including that there bunch of reasons, including that there bunch of reasons, including that there are literally billions of extinct are literally billions of extinct are literally billions of extinct species that are pretty tough to learn species that are pretty tough to learn species that are pretty tough to learn about and to link with living ones. so, about and to link with living ones. so, about and to link with living ones. so, this concept really isn't perfect this concept really isn't perfect this concept really isn't perfect either. and we really things escalate. either. and we really things escalate. either. and we really things escalate. we fall into chaos with our plot when we we fall into chaos with our plot when we we fall into chaos with our plot when we also consider, okay, here's another way also consider, okay, here's another way also consider, okay, here's another way to think about species. uh what if we to think about species. uh what if we to think about species. uh what if we parse them based on environmental parse them based on environmental parse them based on environmental conditions like how polar bears live in conditions like how polar bears live in conditions like how polar bears live in a different type of habitat than grizzly a different type of habitat than grizzly a different type of habitat than grizzly bears well, that starts to fall apart bears well, that starts to fall apart bears well, that starts to fall apart as soon as you consider any number of as soon as you consider any number of as soon as you consider any number of species that live in more than one species that live in more than one species that live in more than one environment. and at this point, we might environment. and at this point, we might environment. and at this point, we might want to level with our audience. we say, want to level with our audience. we say, want to level with our audience. we say, if all of this feels confusing to you, if all of this feels confusing to you, if all of this feels confusing to you, you're actually on to something. in real you're actually on to something. in real you're actually on to something. in real life, it's really difficult to pin down life, it's really difficult to pin down life, it's really difficult to pin down what makes a species. and every single what makes a species. and every single what makes a species. and every single definition of species that scientists definition of species that scientists definition of species that scientists have come up with is imperfect. have come up with is imperfect. have come up with is imperfect. but we still have to resolve it somehow. but we still have to resolve it somehow. but we still have to resolve it somehow. uh and ultimately we land on well humans uh and ultimately we land on well humans uh and ultimately we land on well humans make knowledge by categorizing things make knowledge by categorizing things make knowledge by categorizing things even if those categories aren't as even if those categories aren't as even if those categories aren't as rockolid as we wish they were. um so our rockolid as we wish they were. um so our rockolid as we wish they were. um so our systems for naming and classifying systems for naming and classifying systems for naming and classifying things are totally imperfect and at the things are totally imperfect and at the things are totally imperfect and at the same time super super useful. having same time super super useful. having same time super super useful. having working death species definitions lets working death species definitions lets working death species definitions lets us compare and contrast things notice us compare and contrast things notice us compare and contrast things notice what they have in common. but it's also what they have in common. but it's also what they have in common. but it's also really really interesting when those really really interesting when those really really interesting when those things break and that helps us learn things break and that helps us learn things break and that helps us learn more about the world and about how more about the world and about how more about the world and about how nature works. awesome. thanks megan. um and if any awesome. thanks megan. um and if any questions come up feel free to drop them questions come up feel free to drop them questions come up feel free to drop them in the chat. um, and yes, that we had in the chat. um, and yes, that we had in the chat. um, and yes, that we had talked earlier about the different steps talked earlier about the different steps talked earlier about the different steps and writing, research and writing, and and writing, research and writing, and and writing, research and writing, and now we're getting to editing some of the now we're getting to editing some of the now we're getting to editing some of the invisible work that goes into this. um, invisible work that goes into this. um, invisible work that goes into this. um, and then we had a question from earlier. and then we had a question from earlier. and then we had a question from earlier. i just want to highlight um that came up i just want to highlight um that came up i just want to highlight um that came up from tass. thank you, tass, for asking from tass. thank you, tass, for asking from tass. thank you, tass, for asking this. and as you're telling us more this. and as you're telling us more this. and as you're telling us more about editing, annie, if you want to about editing, annie, if you want to about editing, annie, if you want to tell us, does crash course have a tell us, does crash course have a tell us, does crash course have a plagiarism check used to make sure that plagiarism check used to make sure that plagiarism check used to make sure that someone's not accidentally plagiarizing someone's not accidentally plagiarizing someone's not accidentally plagiarizing or maybe one of your writers is is or maybe one of your writers is is or maybe one of your writers is is plagiarizing and what is your process plagiarizing and what is your process plagiarizing and what is your process for dealing with potential potential for dealing with potential potential for dealing with potential potential plagiarism and the editing process plagiarism and the editing process plagiarism and the editing process gt gt yeah, that's a great question. um, gt gt yeah, that's a great question. um, gt gt yeah, that's a great question. um, towards the end of the editing process, towards the end of the editing process, towards the end of the editing process, we run through all of our scripts uh we run through all of our scripts uh we run through all of our scripts uh through grammarly. they have a great through grammarly. they have a great through grammarly. they have a great plagiarism check function um that checks plagiarism check function um that checks plagiarism check function um that checks it alongside many many many pages and it alongside many many many pages and it alongside many many many pages and documents on the internet. um and documents on the internet. um and documents on the internet. um and fortunately we have like a lot of people fortunately we have like a lot of people fortunately we have like a lot of people with good integrity on our team. so i with good integrity on our team. so i with good integrity on our team. so i don't know if we've ever come across don't know if we've ever come across don't know if we've ever come across anything that's been remotely close. anything that's been remotely close. anything that's been remotely close. sometimes it might be like this sentence sometimes it might be like this sentence sometimes it might be like this sentence is really close to this sentence and is really close to this sentence and is really close to this sentence and then it's like a quote. um, laughter then it's like a quote. um, laughter then it's like a quote. um, laughter so sometimes you might need to like so sometimes you might need to like so sometimes you might need to like reward a sentence if it just came too reward a sentence if it just came too reward a sentence if it just came too close to an original source, but the close to an original source, but the close to an original source, but the vast majority of the time there are no vast majority of the time there are no vast majority of the time there are no problems. um, especially because of how problems. um, especially because of how problems. um, especially because of how many edits we go through, it's just so many edits we go through, it's just so many edits we go through, it's just so far from the source by then that far from the source by then that far from the source by then that plagiarism isn't really a concern. but, plagiarism isn't really a concern. but, plagiarism isn't really a concern. but, uh, if there ever were a concern, we uh, if there ever were a concern, we uh, if there ever were a concern, we would probably address it pretty would probably address it pretty would probably address it pretty swiftly. um, but fortunately, i haven't swiftly. um, but fortunately, i haven't swiftly. um, but fortunately, i haven't run into that problem. run into that problem. run into that problem. um, but yeah, we can get started talking um, but yeah, we can get started talking um, but yeah, we can get started talking about editing. so, something we thought about editing. so, something we thought about editing. so, something we thought might be a good idea to talk about today might be a good idea to talk about today might be a good idea to talk about today is specifically editing a crash course is specifically editing a crash course is specifically editing a crash course intro. um, intros are super important. intro. um, intros are super important. intro. um, intros are super important. the first 30 seconds are essential to a the first 30 seconds are essential to a the first 30 seconds are essential to a video. if you're uh you've ever uploaded video. if you're uh you've ever uploaded video. if you're uh you've ever uploaded anything to youtube, you know about how anything to youtube, you know about how anything to youtube, you know about how long it takes for a view to count. and long it takes for a view to count. and long it takes for a view to count. and then also it's what helps us get the then also it's what helps us get the then also it's what helps us get the attention right away, get it engaged, attention right away, get it engaged, attention right away, get it engaged, and then move through and set up the and then move through and set up the and then move through and set up the rest of the video. um, so yeah, the rest of the video. um, so yeah, the rest of the video. um, so yeah, the first 30 seconds are super important. first 30 seconds are super important. first 30 seconds are super important. and we're going to um talk about some of and we're going to um talk about some of and we're going to um talk about some of the common pitfalls that we see when we the common pitfalls that we see when we the common pitfalls that we see when we are editing um crash courseware scripts. so, the first common issue is when an so, the first common issue is when an intro meanders. um, so you can pull up intro meanders. um, so you can pull up intro meanders. um, so you can pull up that intro, megan. um, so this is an that intro, megan. um, so this is an that intro, megan. um, so this is an original intro for a script for crash original intro for a script for crash original intro for a script for crash course sexed. and the first thing you course sexed. and the first thing you course sexed. and the first thing you might notice is that it's pretty long might notice is that it's pretty long might notice is that it's pretty long for 30 seconds. it's kind of a lot of for 30 seconds. it's kind of a lot of for 30 seconds. it's kind of a lot of information. um, and it's covering a lot information. um, and it's covering a lot information. um, and it's covering a lot of great stuff in context, but that's of great stuff in context, but that's of great stuff in context, but that's not usually what the function of the not usually what the function of the not usually what the function of the intro is. we're more trying to grab intro is. we're more trying to grab intro is. we're more trying to grab attention. an intriguing concept or attention. an intriguing concept or attention. an intriguing concept or question. and so a lot of this question. and so a lot of this question. and so a lot of this information is stuff that would better information is stuff that would better information is stuff that would better suit later on in the script. um, even suit later on in the script. um, even suit later on in the script. um, even the fun joke we have at the end about the fun joke we have at the end about the fun joke we have at the end about how to pronounce lgbtqia, it's not quite how to pronounce lgbtqia, it's not quite how to pronounce lgbtqia, it's not quite going to hit in an intro. so we decided going to hit in an intro. so we decided going to hit in an intro. so we decided to take things in a different direction to take things in a different direction to take things in a different direction for our edited version. and so where we for our edited version. and so where we for our edited version. and so where we came to was talking about our host came to was talking about our host came to was talking about our host sham's first crush. so, first crushes sham's first crush. so, first crushes sham's first crush. so, first crushes are a pretty common experience and we're are a pretty common experience and we're are a pretty common experience and we're able to relate to the audience and have able to relate to the audience and have able to relate to the audience and have them reflect on their own experiences by them reflect on their own experiences by them reflect on their own experiences by starting there. and also, it's kind of starting there. and also, it's kind of starting there. and also, it's kind of juicy. like, it's a little bit gossipy. juicy. like, it's a little bit gossipy. juicy. like, it's a little bit gossipy. it's got that fun big sister feel that it's got that fun big sister feel that it's got that fun big sister feel that we were really shooting for with our we were really shooting for with our we were really shooting for with our host for sex ed. um, and so we just sort host for sex ed. um, and so we just sort host for sex ed. um, and so we just sort of connected some barebones ideas and of connected some barebones ideas and of connected some barebones ideas and then allowed shan to come in and add her then allowed shan to come in and add her then allowed shan to come in and add her personal experiences. and that really personal experiences. and that really personal experiences. and that really lightened the tone. it kind of brought lightened the tone. it kind of brought lightened the tone. it kind of brought us into a very complex idea which is us into a very complex idea which is us into a very complex idea which is what is sexuality um by talking about what is sexuality um by talking about what is sexuality um by talking about something really relatable and easy to something really relatable and easy to something really relatable and easy to understand and um added some punchy understand and um added some punchy understand and um added some punchy questions to get us into the rest of the questions to get us into the rest of the questions to get us into the rest of the script. script. script. so the next common issue is burying the so the next common issue is burying the so the next common issue is burying the lead. so obviously when we're we have an lead. so obviously when we're we have an lead. so obviously when we're we have an intro we want to start with a punch and intro we want to start with a punch and intro we want to start with a punch and this story is super interesting from this story is super interesting from this story is super interesting from native american history. we're talking native american history. we're talking native american history. we're talking about a tribe that was arguably very about a tribe that was arguably very about a tribe that was arguably very successful and then something happened. successful and then something happened. successful and then something happened. they got terminated by the federal they got terminated by the federal they got terminated by the federal government and things really went government and things really went government and things really went downhill very quickly for them. um, so downhill very quickly for them. um, so downhill very quickly for them. um, so it's a really interesting story, but it's a really interesting story, but it's a really interesting story, but honestly the most interesting part is honestly the most interesting part is honestly the most interesting part is the sentence right before chang's the sentence right before chang's the sentence right before chang's introduction where he says uh at the introduction where he says uh at the introduction where he says uh at the dawning of the termination era that's dawning of the termination era that's dawning of the termination era that's exactly what makes them a target. so we exactly what makes them a target. so we exactly what makes them a target. so we thought why don't we move some things thought why don't we move some things thought why don't we move some things around to try to make this um more around to try to make this um more around to try to make this um more interesting. so in our final version, we interesting. so in our final version, we interesting. so in our final version, we started with that idea, shifted it to started with that idea, shifted it to started with that idea, shifted it to the top and said things were looking up the top and said things were looking up the top and said things were looking up for the monomony tribe of wisconsin and for the monomony tribe of wisconsin and for the monomony tribe of wisconsin and that's exactly what made them a target. that's exactly what made them a target. that's exactly what made them a target. so immediately we feel a little bit more so immediately we feel a little bit more so immediately we feel a little bit more suspense, a little bit more intrigue suspense, a little bit more intrigue suspense, a little bit more intrigue just by moving one sentence and then we just by moving one sentence and then we just by moving one sentence and then we keep that same context, but now we have keep that same context, but now we have keep that same context, but now we have a reason to be interested and then just a reason to be interested and then just a reason to be interested and then just kind of put a bow on it at the end by kind of put a bow on it at the end by kind of put a bow on it at the end by saying, you know, the monomony had a saying, you know, the monomony had a saying, you know, the monomony had a safety net, but it was about to break. safety net, but it was about to break. safety net, but it was about to break. so, we're able to really build suspense so, we're able to really build suspense so, we're able to really build suspense in um the intro just by shifting a few in um the intro just by shifting a few in um the intro just by shifting a few parts around. um and our oh, go ahead, kayla. um and our oh, go ahead, kayla. gt gt um awesome. just nope, you keep going. i gt gt um awesome. just nope, you keep going. i gt gt um awesome. just nope, you keep going. i will i'll

it could probably little bit generic and it could probably little bit generic and it could probably pack a little bit more of a punch. so, pack a little bit more of a punch. so, pack a little bit more of a punch. so, we decided to shake things up a little we decided to shake things up a little we decided to shake things up a little bit in our edited version where we sort bit in our edited version where we sort bit in our edited version where we sort of put the viewer themselves into a of put the viewer themselves into a of put the viewer themselves into a scenario. we said, picture this. you're scenario. we said, picture this. you're scenario. we said, picture this. you're in a cozy room surrounded by people in a cozy room surrounded by people in a cozy room surrounded by people

comfort and then a sense of safety and comfort and then a sense of safety and comfort and then disrupts that immediately that sort of disrupts that immediately that sort of disrupts that immediately that sort of counterintuition is something we often counterintuition is something we often counterintuition is something we often use in our episodes. um, and also it use in our episodes. um, and also it use in our episodes. um, and also it tackles that kind of relatable question tackles that kind of relatable question tackles that kind of relatable question that a lot of people ask themselves, that a lot of people ask themselves, that a lot of people ask themselves, which is like, would i fall for a cult which is like, would i fall for a cult which is like, would i fall for a cult it's kind of a an intriguing juicy it's kind of a an intriguing juicy it's kind of a an intriguing juicy question. um, and then we tacked on a question. um, and then we tacked on a question. um, and then we tacked on a bit of a punchier end to that as well by bit of a punchier end to that as well by bit of a punchier end to that as well by saying, can we really tell the saying, can we really tell the saying, can we really tell the difference between a religion and a difference between a religion and a difference between a religion and a cult so, we sort of tightened things up cult so, we sort of tightened things up cult so, we sort of tightened things up and made them a little bit more packing and made them a little bit more packing and made them a little bit more packing a punch. um, and just heightened it. you a punch. um, and just heightened it. you a punch. um, and just heightened it. you know, the original intro was fine and know, the original intro was fine and know, the original intro was fine and great, but we were able to make it even great, but we were able to make it even great, but we were able to make it even better. and so, you know, these are just better. and so, you know, these are just better. and so, you know, these are just intros, but we apply a lot of these same intros, but we apply a lot of these same intros, but we apply a lot of these same tactics to the rest of the script as tactics to the rest of the script as tactics to the rest of the script as well to make things engaging by adding well to make things engaging by adding well to make things engaging by adding hypothetical scenarios and jokes and hypothetical scenarios and jokes and hypothetical scenarios and jokes and personal reflections from the host. all personal reflections from the host. all personal reflections from the host. all these things can kind of tie together these things can kind of tie together these things can kind of tie together the whole episode. um, but the intro is the whole episode. um, but the intro is the whole episode. um, but the intro is where that sort of shines right at the where that sort of shines right at the where that sort of shines right at the start. gt gt awesome. thanks, annie. and then a gt gt awesome. thanks, annie. and then a question that came up um that was sort question that came up um that was sort question that came up um that was sort of timely when talking about sexed is of timely when talking about sexed is of timely when talking about sexed is from rachel and from rachel and from rachel and rachel's question is did theme rachel's question is did theme rachel's question is did theme um but i think this was actually about um but i think this was actually about um but i think this was actually about the host because sometimes the subject the host because sometimes the subject the host because sometimes the subject matter expert and the host are different matter expert and the host are different matter expert and the host are different people. um but did the host write the people. um but did the host write the people. um but did the host write the intro about their crush or did a writer intro about their crush or did a writer intro about their crush or did a writer write it from their perspective and i write it from their perspective and i write it from their perspective and i feel like that leads in really nicely to feel like that leads in really nicely to feel like that leads in really nicely to this next section about balancing all this next section about balancing all this next section about balancing all that information with making it fun and that information with making it fun and that information with making it fun and funny. um, and then just want to add one funny. um, and then just want to add one funny. um, and then just want to add one more question on there because lucy lid more question on there because lucy lid more question on there because lucy lid sort of anticipated this next coming up sort of anticipated this next coming up sort of anticipated this next coming up as well and asked, do you have any as well and asked, do you have any as well and asked, do you have any advice or resources converting advice or resources converting advice or resources converting complicated educational materials in a complicated educational materials in a complicated educational materials in a conversational tone i think you'll conversational tone i think you'll conversational tone i think you'll kind of answer this one naturally, but kind of answer this one naturally, but kind of answer this one naturally, but just wanted to put those out there as just wanted to put those out there as just wanted to put those out there as you're as you're talking about this next you're

different subject matter expert. um, but we did um subject matter expert. um, but we did um subject matter expert. um, but we did um sort of build a framework. sometimes sort of build a framework. sometimes sort of build a framework. sometimes we'll we'll write a section of a script we'll we'll write a section of a script we'll we'll write a section of a script where we say something like in brackets, where we say something like in brackets, where we say something like in brackets, you know, tk, which is the sort of you know, tk, which is the sort of you know, tk, which is the sort of journalist uh shortand for to come. um, journalist uh shortand for to come. um, journalist uh shortand for to come. um, uh, host experiences. so i think what we uh, host experiences. so i think what we uh, host experiences. so i think what we had in our sort of intervening episode had in our sort of intervening episode had in our sort of intervening episode uh uh edit of this um intro was you know uh uh edit of this um intro was you know uh uh edit of this um intro was you know my first crush my first crush my first crush name um and then name um and then name um and then gt gt something etc etc and then uh i think we gt gt something etc etc and then uh i think we gt gt something etc etc and then uh i think we had sort of added the stuff about being had sort of added the stuff about being had sort of added the stuff about being boy obsessed and boy obsessed and boy obsessed and gt gt boy bands because we had also talked to gt gt boy bands because we had also talked to gt gt boy bands because we had also talked to shan um before we started scripting shan um before we started scripting shan um before we started scripting about her personality and experiences so about her personality and experiences so about her personality and experiences so we could sort of fill in a little bit of we could sort of fill in a little bit of we could sort of fill in a little bit of the gaps with what we already knew about the gaps with what we already knew about the gaps with what we already knew about her and then she was able provide the her and then she was able provide the her and then she was able provide the specifics later. so, the hosts specifics later. so, the hosts specifics later. so, the hosts definitely have um a chance to add their definitely have um a chance to add their definitely have um a chance to add their sort of flare to the episodes um as they sort of flare to the episodes um as they sort of flare to the episodes um as they review them before we ship them. review them before we ship them. review them before we ship them. gt gt yeah. and i would say i think my best gt gt yeah. and i would say i think my best gt gt yeah. and i would say i think my best advice for making complicated advice for making complicated advice for making complicated information easy to understand is really information easy to understand is really information easy to understand is really um tr um tr um tr what it was like when you first learned what it was like when you first learned what it was like when you first learned it. and that can be really hard if you it. and that can be really hard if you it. and that can be really hard if you know it really well. but if you can put know it really well. but if you can put know it really well. but if you can put yourself back in in that space of yourself back in in that space of yourself back in in that space of learning something fresh and what learning something fresh and what learning something fresh and what surprised you, what subverted your surprised you, what subverted your surprised you, what subverted your expectations, what confused you, then i expectations, what confused you, then i expectations, what confused you, then i think that helps. um, i think oftentimes think that helps. um, i think oftentimes think that helps. um, i think oftentimes when we know something really well, we when we know something really well, we when we know something really well, we skip a lot of steps in explaining it skip a lot of steps in explaining it skip a lot of steps in explaining it because they just seem obvious. and if because they just seem obvious. and if because they just seem obvious. and if you can like think back to, you know, you can like think back to, you know, you can like think back to, you know, sitting in that freshman year classroom sitting in that freshman year classroom sitting in that freshman year classroom where something really hooked you for where something really hooked you for where something really hooked you for the first time um and and try to or or the first time um and and try to or or the first time um and and try to or or if you can't like talk to a person who if you can't like talk to a person who if you can't like talk to a person who doesn't know about it, i think is really doesn't know about it, i think is really doesn't know about it, i think is really good advice. we often if in some cases good advice. we often if in some cases good advice. we often if in some cases if we do have an expert writer, it's all if we do have an expert writer, it's all if we do have an expert writer, it's all the more important that we don't have an the more important that we don't have an the more important that we don't have an expert editor. we we always want uh lay expert editor. we we always want uh lay expert editor. we we always want uh lay someone who's editing the script to be a someone who's editing the script to be a someone who's editing the script to be a lay person relative to the script lay person relative to the script lay person relative to the script subject matter. thankfully, that's subject matter. thankfully, that's subject matter. thankfully, that's really easy at crash course because we really easy at crash course because we really easy at crash course because we do a crash course on every possible do a crash course on every possible do a crash course on every possible subject and no one can be an expert on subject and no one can be an expert on subject and no one can be an expert on every possible subject. but yeah, i every possible subject. but yeah, i every possible subject. but yeah, i would say making sure someone is is would say making sure someone is is would say making sure someone is is genuinely learning it for the first time genuinely learning it for the first time genuinely learning it for the first time uh can react to that to your work on it uh can react to that to your work on it uh can react to that to your work on it and that helps a lot. okay, i'm going to and that helps a lot. okay, i'm going to and that helps a lot. okay, i'm going to click back forward. i had took us back click back forward. i had took us back click back forward. i had took us back to that um intro when we were talking to that um intro when we were talking to that um intro when we were talking about that. but this is another big about that. but this is another big about that. but this is another big question we get about making things fun question we get about making things fun question we get about making things fun and funny. and i'm going to talk a and funny. and i'm going to talk a and funny. and i'm going to talk a little bit about here about just like little bit about here about just like little bit about here about just like how we think about humor here at crash how we think about humor here at crash how we think about humor here at crash course. um so i'll start with just some course. um so i'll start with just some course. um so i'll start with just some like basic principles of humor writing like basic principles of humor writing like basic principles of humor writing that are true for any type of humor that are true for any type of humor that are true for any type of humor writing. the first is that quantity is writing. the first is that quantity is writing. the first is that quantity is the key to quality. the best comedy the key to quality. the best comedy the key to quality. the best comedy writers invisibly write dozens and writers invisibly write dozens and writers invisibly write dozens and hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes, but you only see the best ones. but you only see the best ones. but you only see the best ones. laughter laughter laughter and so sometimes we're really hard on and so sometimes we're really hard on and so sometimes we're really hard on ourselves uh because we're like, man, i ourselves uh because we're like, man, i ourselves uh because we're like, man, i wrote five jokes and they're all bad. um wrote five jokes and they're all bad. um wrote five jokes and they're all bad. um but that's because we're imagining we're but that's because we're imagining we're but that's because we're imagining we're not imagining the intense failure rate not imagining the intense failure rate not imagining the intense failure rate that real comedians are experiencing and that real comedians are experiencing and that real comedians are experiencing and just filtering before it gets to us. um, just filtering before it gets to us. um, just filtering before it gets to us. um, related to that, we work hard on our related to that, we work hard on our related to that, we work hard on our team to make space for there to be a team to make space for there to be a team to make space for there to be a clown mode and an edit mode. and what i clown mode and an edit mode. and what i clown mode and an edit mode. and what i mean by that is that we try to create mean by that is that we try to create mean by that is that we try to create space in clown mode where we don't judge space in clown mode where we don't judge space in clown mode where we don't judge ourselves where we say the bad idea ourselves where we say the bad idea ourselves where we say the bad idea because maybe the bad idea will spark because maybe the bad idea will spark because maybe the bad idea will spark something in someone else that leads to something in someone else that leads to something in someone else that leads to a good idea. and if we never say the bad a good idea. and if we never say the bad a good idea. and if we never say the bad idea, then we never get to the quantity, idea, then we never get to the quantity, idea, then we never get to the quantity, which is the key to the quality, right which is the key to the quality, right which is the key to the quality, right like you got to clear out all the bad like you got to clear out all the bad like you got to clear out all the bad ideas in order to make space for the ideas in order to make space for the ideas in order to make space for the good ideas. and um yeah, then later good ideas. and um yeah, then later good ideas. and um yeah, then later there's edit mode where you are there's edit mode where you are there's edit mode where you are identifying, okay, this one joke out of identifying, okay, this one joke out of identifying, okay, this one joke out of the 50 options is the best one and the 50 options is the best one and the 50 options is the best one and you're culling. and these are incredibly you're culling. and these are incredibly you're culling. and these are incredibly self- sustaining. you can only be brave self- sustaining. you can only be brave self- sustaining. you can only be brave enough to and vulnerable enough to have enough to and vulnerable enough to have enough to and vulnerable enough to have a clown mode if you know that later a clown mode if you know that later a clown mode if you know that later there will be the edit mode so your bad there will be the edit mode so your bad there will be the edit mode so your bad ideas won't be showcased. you know these ideas won't be showcased. you know these ideas won't be showcased. you know these are you really need both uh in order to are you really need both uh in order to are you really need both uh in order to have like a successful humor team. um have like a successful humor team. um have like a successful humor team. um and the other thing i would say is take and the other thing i would say is take and the other thing i would say is take stock of your toolbox. um there are all stock of your toolbox. um there are all stock of your toolbox. um there are all kinds of humor tools. um humor is very kinds of humor tools. um humor is very kinds of humor tools. um humor is very very often formulaic. it's based on very often formulaic. it's based on very often formulaic. it's based on repeated and predictable techniques that repeated and predictable techniques that repeated and predictable techniques that are going to work again and again in new are going to work again and again in new are going to work again and again in new contexts. um, and so just to give you contexts. um, and so just to give you contexts. um, and so just to give you some examples, i there are different some examples, i there are different some examples, i there are different different types of toolboxes that different types of toolboxes that different types of toolboxes that everybody can have based on your unique everybody can have based on your unique everybody can have based on your unique context. um, so i'll tell you a little context. um, so i'll tell you a little context. um, so i'll tell you a little bit about the crash course toolbox for bit about the crash course toolbox for bit about the crash course toolbox for humor. humor. humor. one question we ask ourselves if we feel one question we ask ourselves if we feel one question we ask ourselves if we feel like something is not funny enough is, like something is not funny enough is, like something is not funny enough is, can we add some physical action for us, can we add some physical action for us, can we add some physical action for us, uh, the cra the expectation of the uh, the cra the expectation of the uh, the cra the expectation of the viewer is that the host is going to be viewer is that the host is going to be viewer is that the host is going to be sitting at the desk. they're a talking sitting at the desk. they're a talking sitting at the desk. they're a talking head. so, anytime we can put them in a head. so, anytime we can put them in a head. so, anytime we can put them in a new space or interacting with the world new space or interacting with the world new space or interacting with the world in a new way, that's going to surprise in a new way, that's going to surprise in a new way, that's going to surprise people and that adds an element of people and that adds an element of people and that adds an element of humor. um, so in this case, in native humor. um, so in this case, in native humor. um, so in this case, in native american history, we're talking about american history, we're talking about american history, we're talking about busting myths about about native busting myths about about native busting myths about about native american people. and um rather than just american people. and um rather than just american people. and um rather than just talking about that as a metaphor, we talking about that as a metaphor, we talking about that as a metaphor, we took it real literally and we have him took it real literally and we have him took it real literally and we have him putting the myths into a bottle and then putting the myths into a bottle and then putting the myths into a bottle and then smashing them with a bat. um, so fun. smashing them with a bat. um, so fun. smashing them with a bat. um, so fun. uh, another thing we ask ourselves is uh, another thing we ask ourselves is uh, another thing we ask ourselves is would it help to have a character say would it help to have a character say would it help to have a character say it again, both of these are these are it again, both of these are these are it again, both of these are these are pretty sensitive examples. um, here's uh pretty sensitive examples. um, here's uh pretty sensitive examples. um, here's uh this is from the religions series. uh, this is from the religions series. uh, this is from the religions series. uh, and we wanted to think about how can we and we wanted to think about how can we and we wanted to think about how can we talk about religious misconceptions talk about religious misconceptions talk about religious misconceptions which are essentially they're which are essentially they're which are essentially they're stereotypes about people, sometimes stereotypes about people, sometimes stereotypes about people, sometimes marginalized groups. um how can we talk marginalized groups. um how can we talk marginalized groups. um how can we talk about those um but not in a way that about those um but not in a way that about those um but not in a way that feels overly preachy or judgmental. and feels overly preachy or judgmental. and feels overly preachy or judgmental. and it really helped to add a character. so it really helped to add a character. so it really helped to add a character. so we had created this character called the we had created this character called the we had created this character called the devil's advocate. we had him facetime devil's advocate. we had him facetime devil's advocate. we had him facetime john um our host and wear a tracksuit john um our host and wear a tracksuit john um our host and wear a tracksuit and a headset and just be like the least and a headset and just be like the least and a headset and just be like the least likable person um so that we could then likable person um so that we could then likable person um so that we could then correct those misconceptions in a more correct those misconceptions in a more correct those misconceptions in a more playful way. another thing uh ties right playful way. another thing uh ties right playful way. another thing uh ties right back to what annie was talking about back to what annie was talking about back to what annie was talking about with our sexed um intro example earlier, with our sexed um intro example earlier, with our sexed um intro example earlier, but it's one thing if that if that intro but it's one thing if that if that intro but it's one thing if that if that intro had been focused on um we all have had been focused on um we all have had been focused on um we all have crushes. that's fine. but uh a good crushes. that's fine. but uh a good crushes. that's fine. but uh a good comedy principle is like it's better to comedy principle is like it's better to comedy

we'll just quickly wrap up and then just we'll just quickly wrap up and then we'll transition into slidesh into more we'll transition into slidesh into more we'll transition into slidesh into more faqs. um we saw this in your joke faqs. um we saw this in your joke faqs. um we saw this in your joke examples, but other ways to finaness a examples, but other ways to finaness a examples, but other ways to finaness a joke is to think about contrast. um, so joke is to think about contrast. um, so joke is to think about contrast. um, so in the i love christmas joke example, in the i love christmas joke example, in the i love christmas joke example, having the presents the be as far as having the presents the be as far as having the presents the be as far as possible away from the joy of childhood possible away from the joy of childhood possible away from the joy of childhood being gone forever. if it was like being gone forever. if it was like being gone forever. if it was like presents, family, and like being a presents, family, and like being a presents, family, and like being a little tired, then that's not that's not little tired, then that's not that's not little tired, then that's not that's not as funny because the contrast is too as funny because the contrast is too as funny because the contrast is too small. i think that i think the person small. i think that i think the person small. i think that i think the person who wrote about candy coded h hurtling who wrote about candy coded h hurtling who wrote about candy coded h hurtling toward death intuitively understood that toward death intuitively understood that toward death intuitively understood that that was a good contrast. um, another that was a good contrast. um, another that was a good contrast. um, another thing is being being more specific. um, thing is being being more specific. um, thing is being being more specific. um, so a specific detail is always funnier so a specific detail is always funnier so a specific detail is always funnier than a broad description. that's why i than a broad description. that's why i than a broad description. that's why i think we've all heard this in different think we've all heard this in different think we've all heard this in different circumstances. it's always funny to just circumstances. it's always funny to just circumstances. it's always

because unfortunately there are a lot um because unfortunately there are a lot um because unfortunately there are a lot of problematic figures that uh we learn of problematic figures that uh we learn of problematic figures that uh we learn about various topics. um i think part of about various topics. um i think part of about various topics. um i think part of it has to do with tone. we try not to it has to do with tone. we try not to it has to do with tone. we try not to sort of valorize those people um or sort of valorize those people um or sort of valorize those people um or overly praise them for their overly praise them for their overly praise them for their contributions. sometimes we'll just contributions. sometimes we'll just contributions. sometimes we'll just present it

a lot of curricula. be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. be um highlighted in a lot of curricula. so sometimes there's room to say um this so sometimes there's room to say um this so sometimes there's room to say um this person in science was a eugenicist. so person in science was a eugenicist. so person in science was a eugenicist. so take everything they say with a grain of take

xyz reason a resource to learn more about reason a resource to learn more about reason a resource to learn more about it. so it really depends on the scenario it. so it really depends on the scenario it. so it really depends on the scenario i think. gt gt awesome. and then finn brener just gt gt awesome. and then finn brener just asked, does a host ever make changes to asked, does a host ever make changes to asked, does a host ever make changes to the script on set in my experience, the script on set in my experience, the script on set in my experience, i've never had that not happen. uh but i've never had that not happen. uh but i've never had that not happen. uh but i' which we love our hosts for that. uh i' which we love our hosts for that. uh i' which we love our hosts for that. uh um and but i wondered too if you could um and but i wondered too if you could um and but i wondered too if you could talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk about maybe some examples and maybe talk more about the um the read through talk more about the um the read through talk more about the um the read through um the table and and that process and um the table and and that process and um the table and and that process and how that helps with that. yeah, we have how that helps with that. yeah, we have how that helps with that. yeah, we have a lot of structures in place to try to a lot of structures in place to try to a lot of structures in place to try to help the host give input a number of help the host give input a number of help the host give input a number of times before we're on set because we times before we're on set because we times before we're on set because we used to have the host make more changes used to have the host make more changes used to have the host make more changes on set and we're really open to it on set and we're really open to it on set and we're really open to it because that's when a lot of playfulness because that's when a lot of playfulness because that's when a lot of playfulness can come out, but um we've fact checked can come out, but um we've fact checked can come out, but um we've fact checked everything and sometimes things are so everything and sometimes things are so everything and sometimes things are so so subtle and you lose the word 'the' so subtle and you lose the word 'the' so subtle and you lose the word 'the' and suddenly it's not exactly correct and suddenly it's not exactly correct and suddenly it's not exactly correct anymore. and um so it's hard to like anymore. and um so it's hard to like anymore. and um so it's hard to like kind of flag those things on the spot. kind of flag those things on the spot. kind of flag those things on the spot. so, uh, a couple of things we do, like so, uh, a couple of things we do, like so, uh, a couple of things we do, like annie alluded to earlier, one thing we annie alluded to earlier, one thing we annie alluded to earlier, one thing we do, um, is when we have a new host, we do, um, is when we have a new host, we do, um, is when we have a new host, we have like an interview with them where have like an interview with them where have like an interview with them where we talk about like what are your we talk about like what are your we talk about like what are your embarrassing stories what's your family embarrassing stories what's your family embarrassing stories what's your family like do you have pets what's a weird like do you have pets what's a weird like do you have pets what's a weird opinion you have about the world um, so opinion you have about the world um, so opinion you have about the world um, so we try to get, you know, an we try to get, you know, an we try to get, you know, an understanding of what makes them tick. understanding of what makes them tick. understanding of what makes them tick. and then we we write some jokes with and then we we write some jokes with and then we we write some jokes with them and with that in mind. and with them and with that in mind. and with them and with that in mind. and with then we leave we also leave a lot of uh then we leave we also leave a lot of uh then we leave we also leave a lot of uh placeholders for them. um, like annie placeholders for them. um, like annie placeholders for them. um, like annie mentioned, um, then they review the mentioned, um, then they review the mentioned, um, then they review the scripts in advance. they fill in the scripts in advance. they fill in the scripts in advance. they fill in the placeholders. we encourage them to react placeholders. we encourage them to react placeholders. we encourage them to react to other parts of the script as well. to other parts of the script as well. to other parts of the script as well. so, we often get new suggestions for so, we often get new suggestions for so, we often get new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for intros from hosts, new suggestions for um, you know, anecdotes, things like um, you know, anecdotes, things like um, you know, anecdotes, things like that um, at that stage. and then, yeah, that um, at that stage. and then, yeah, that um, at that stage. and then, yeah, then we do what we call a table read. then we do what we call a table read. then we do what we call a table read. it's it's a remote table read. we're all it's it's a remote table read. we're all it's it's a remote table read. we're all around a virtual table, but there's around a virtual table, but there's around a virtual table, but there's going to be the producer, the script going to be the producer, the script going to be the producer, the script editor, and the host all in a room editor, and the host all in a room editor, and the host all in a room reading through the scripts. and in reading through the scripts. and in reading through the scripts. and in those moments, um, we notice when the those moments, um, we notice when the those moments, um, we notice when the host, if they stumble repeatedly over a host, if they stumble repeatedly over a host, if they stumble repeatedly over a line, then it's probably the line, it's line, then it's probably the line, it's line, then it's probably the line, it's probably not them. um, so we'll take a probably not them. um, so we'll take a probably not them. um, so we'll take a moment and we'll revise that line to moment and we'll revise that line to moment and we'll revise that line to make it sound more natural for them. um, make it sound more natural for them. um, make it sound more natural for them. um, also those are moments where sometimes also those are moments where sometimes also those are moments where sometimes if a joke doesn't quite land in real if a joke doesn't quite land in real if a joke doesn't quite land in real time, we'll we'll toss the ball around time, we'll we'll toss the ball around time, we'll we'll toss the ball around trying to make the joke a little bit trying to make the joke a little bit trying to make the joke a little bit funnier. um, if something or just funnier. um, if something or just funnier. um, if something or just something feels wrong, um, then we'll something feels wrong, um, then we'll something feels wrong, um, then we'll make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. make a note to cut it or to rephrase it. um then yeah, when we get on set, we can um then yeah, when we get on set, we can um then yeah, when we get on set, we can never and we would never want to fully never and we would never want to fully never and we would never want to fully um get rid of host changes on set, but um get rid of host changes on set, but um get rid of host changes on set, but we try to have like one word perfect we try to have like one word perfect we try to have like one word perfect recording and then one recording with recording and then one recording with recording and then one recording with improvisations. so that way if later improvisations. so that way if later improvisations. so that way if later when we're going through uh we notice when we're going through uh we notice when we're going through uh we notice that there's a factual discrepancy, we that there's a factual discrepancy, we that there's a factual discrepancy, we have a take with the word perfect have a take with the word perfect have a take with the word perfect version that we can substitute in for version that we can substitute in for version that we can substitute in for that portion. thank you. um, cool. and then we had a thank you. um, cool. and then we had a couple questions about working with fact couple questions about working with fact couple questions about working with fact checker fact checkers and subject matter checker fact checkers and subject matter checker fact checkers and subject matter experts. so, i'm just going to read a experts. so, i'm just going to read a experts. so, i'm just going to read a couple of them and and we can have a couple of them and and we can have a couple of them and and we can have a little bit of a conversation about it. little bit of a conversation about it. little bit of a conversation about it. so, syjoy asks, hi, syd. hi, so, syjoy asks, hi, syd. hi, so, syjoy asks, hi, syd. hi, jacqueline. is there anything you do in jacqueline. is there anything you do in jacqueline. is there anything you do in the writing process to make it easier the writing process to make it easier the writing process to make it easier for the fact checker, especially if info for the fact checker, especially if info for the fact checker, especially if info is from the subject matter expert and is from the subject matter expert and is from the subject matter expert and not a primary reference what what not a primary reference what what not a primary reference what what happens in that situation. and then happens in that situation. and then happens in that situation. and then sarah j also asked, how many subject sarah j also asked, how many subject sarah j also asked, how many subject matter experts do you reach out to when matter experts do you reach out to when matter experts do you reach out to when fact-checking and developing the script fact-checking and developing the script fact-checking and developing the script does it vary by topic does it vary by topic does it vary by topic gt gt yeah, i can jump in. um, yeah, gt gt yeah, i can jump in. um, yeah, gt gt yeah, i can jump in. um, yeah, factchecking is is its own animal. um, factchecking is is its own animal. um, factchecking is is its own animal. um, but part of what our scripting process but part of what our scripting process but part of what our scripting process is like is is keeping the sources with is like is is keeping the sources with is like is is keeping the sources with the claims as long as

go into some heads up, i'm about to go into some pretty heavy truths, so please take care pretty heavy truths, so please take care pretty heavy truths, so please take care as you watch on. today, there is a as you watch on. today, there is a as you watch on. today, there is a crisis of missing and murdered crisis of missing and murdered crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. indigenous women are indigenous women. indigenous women are indigenous women. indigenous women are killed at a rate 10 times higher than killed at a rate 10 times higher than killed at a rate 10 times higher than the national average. they're more the national average. they're more the national average. they're more likely than other populations to be likely than other populations to be likely than other populations to be assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes, and the vast majority identify their and the vast majority identify their and the vast majority identify their attackers as nonindians. attackers as nonindians. attackers as nonindians. but under federal law, tribes are but under federal law, tribes are but under federal law, tribes are limited in what they can do to solve limited in what they can do to solve limited in what they can do to solve these crimes because they generally these crimes because they generally these crimes because they generally don't have full authority to prosecute don't have full authority to prosecute don't have full authority to prosecute non-indians, which goes back to those non-indians, which goes back to those non-indians, which goes back to those fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty. federal indian law says tribal nations federal indian law says tribal nations federal indian law says tribal nations have the right to govern themselves, but have the right to govern themselves, but have the right to govern themselves, but not to exercise governance over not to exercise governance over not to exercise governance over non-natives. so, criminals can sometimes non-natives. so, criminals can sometimes non-natives. so, criminals can sometimes go unpunished through this loophole. the go unpunished through this loophole. the go unpunished through this loophole. the violence against women act has tried to violence against women act has tried to violence against women act has tried to address this problem by giving tribes address this problem by giving tribes address this problem by giving tribes jurisdiction over non-indians in jurisdiction over non-indians in jurisdiction over non-indians in instances of sexual violence, stalking instances of sexual violence, stalking instances of sexual violence, stalking or assault on tribal land. but even or assault on tribal land. but even or assault on tribal land. but even then, tribal ability to punish then, tribal ability to punish then, tribal ability to punish non-indians remains limited. because the non-indians remains limited. because the non-indians remains limited. because the laws are so complicated, indigenous laws are so complicated, indigenous laws are so complicated, indigenous women are treated differently from other women are treated differently from other women are treated differently from other victims. and usually, this means the victims. and usually, this means the victims. and usually, this means the investigations are a lot slower, which investigations are a lot slower, which investigations are a lot slower, which makes it all too easy for the cycle of makes it all too easy for the cycle of makes it all too easy for the cycle of violence to continue. violence to continue. violence to continue. like i said, this is heavy stuff, but i like i said, this is heavy stuff, but i like i said, this is heavy stuff, but i hope the more that we understand it, the hope the more that we understand it, the hope the more that we understand it, the more we can work to solve it. now, we've more we can work to solve it. now, we've more we can work to solve it. now, we've seen how federal indian law can impact seen how federal indian law can impact seen how federal indian law can impact individuals when traveling or when individuals when traveling or when individuals when traveling or when victims of a crime. but to take it even victims of a crime. but to take it even victims of a crime. but to take it even further, let's look at how the law further, let's look at how the law further, let's look at how the law impacts whole communities. to start, impacts whole communities. to start, impacts whole communities. to start, have you noticed i keep using the word have you noticed i keep using the word have you noticed i keep using the word indian rather than native american indian rather than native american indian rather than native american well, that's because federal indian law well, that's because federal indian law well, that's because federal indian law only applies to american indians, which only applies to american indians, which only applies to american indians, which unlike native american, is the official unlike native american, is the official unlike native american, is the official legal term for enrolled members of legal term for

as a nation by the us isn't recognized as a nation by the us isn't recognized as a nation by the us governments. so, they aren't covered governments. so, they aren't covered governments. so, they aren't covered under the american indian label, at under the american indian label, at under the american indian label, at least by law. on top of that, each tribe least by law. on top of that, each

where were we right. the ever complex tango of law. so, we've ever complex tango of law. so, we've ever complex tango of law. so, we've seen how federal indian law impacts seen how federal indian law impacts seen how federal indian law impacts individuals and whole communities. now, individuals and whole communities. now, individuals and whole communities. now, let's look at how it applies to land. let's look at how it applies to land. let's look at how it applies to land. and really, all these layers are and really, all these layers are and really, all these layers are connected. take the term indian country. connected. take the term indian country. connected. take the term indian country. to us, that's just another word for to us, that's just another word for to us, that's just another word for home. but it's also a legal term that home. but it's also a legal term that home. but it's also a legal term that broadly describes land held in trust for broadly describes land held

around. and it also involves complex personal nbsp decisions. but knowing what abortion is nbsp nbsp is a key part of any comprehensive sex ed course. we won t get too deep into the politics or nbsp legal situation surrounding abortion today, nbsp nbsp because those factors are ever-changing. but we will shine a light on what s true nbsp about abortions, and who gets them. hi i m shan boodram and nbsp this is crash course sex ed. theme music head s up in today s episode, we ll be talking nbsp about sensitive topics, including miscarriages, nbsp nbsp and why people get abortions. so please keep nbsp that in mind and take care when watching. when people talk about abortion, they re nbsp usually referring to the medical process nbsp nbsp that ends a pregnancy. that s called an nbsp induced abortion, and that s our focus today. but there s also spontaneous abortions. that s nbsp the medical term for a miscarriage, when someone s nbsp nbsp body terminates a pregnancy on its own before the nbsp 20th week. a spontaneous abortion might require nbsp nbsp some of the same medical care used in induced nbsp abortions, but it depends on the specific case. a healthcare provider can share nbsp more information if you need it, nbsp nbsp and you can learn more about why nbsp miscarriages happen in episode 9. we ll be referring to cisgender nbsp women a lot in this episode, nbsp nbsp since that s who most of the research nbsp and discussion focuses on, but trans nbsp nbsp folk may also need pregnancy and reproductive nbsp health care services, including abortions. now when it comes to induced abortions, nbsp there are two main ways they can happen. nbsp nbsp the first is by taking medication nbsp two kinds of pills over two days, nbsp nbsp that are prescribed by a doctor or nbsp another licensed healthcare provider. the first pill stops a pregnancy from developing nbsp further, and the second pill empties the uterus. nbsp nbsp a medical abortion can happen entirely at nbsp home or partially at a doctor s office, nbsp nbsp and it can happen up to 10 or 11 weeks after nbsp the first day of someone s last period. the second kind is an in-clinic abortion, nbsp when a doctor uses light suction to empty nbsp nbsp the uterus. while the clinic visit may take nbsp longer, the procedure itself usually lasts 10 nbsp nbsp minutes or less, and can happen up to 14 nbsp to 16 weeks after someone s last period. there s also another version of in-clinic nbsp abortion that can happen up to 24 weeks nbsp nbsp after someone s last period, which can be a nbsp little more involved and take a bit longer. these kinds of abortions are nbsp significantly less common, though. in 2021, about ninety-three percent of abortions nbsp in the u.s. happened in the first thirteen weeks nbsp nbsp of pregnancy, according to the cdc. and less nbsp than one percent happened after twenty-one weeks. as far as safety goes, surveys have found nbsp that when abortions are done under the care nbsp nbsp of a trained medical provider, nbsp they rarely have complications. a 2015 study that looked at nbsp data from more than 50,000 nbsp nbsp patients reported that complications nbsp happen in about two percent of cases. like we ll say many times during this nbsp episode, though, every pregnancy and nbsp nbsp every person is unique. and if you d like nbsp to learn more about any of these procedures, nbsp nbsp you can find more information in the description. teen shan so, who gets abortions and why good questions the short answer nbsp is well, there is no short answer. the guttmacher institute, which has been nbsp tracking this kind of data since the late 1960s, nbsp nbsp estimates that just under a quarter of women in nbsp the u.s. will have an abortion before they re 45. nbsp nbsp this number is lower than it was in the past, nbsp and researchers point to a variety of reasons nbsp nbsp for that, like better contraception nbsp use and fewer teenagers having sex. but that estimate of just under a quarter of u.s. nbsp women represents millions of people. and when you nbsp nbsp ask that big of a group of people why they might nbsp do anything, you re gonna get a huge variety of answers. one of the most widely-referenced nbsp studies that s been done about nbsp nbsp abortion is called the turnaway study. nbsp it started collecting data in 2008, nbsp nbsp and surveyed hundreds of women about their nbsp experiences with abortion, over multiple years. as part of that study, about 950 women nbsp shared why they were seeking abortions. nbsp nbsp and forty percent of them said it nbsp was at least partly for financial nbsp nbsp reasons either in general, or because nbsp of specific reasons like unemployment. meanwhile, about twenty percent of study nbsp participants said they were seeking an abortion nbsp nbsp because having a child would interfere with nbsp their school, work, or other life opportunities. nbsp nbsp and just under thirty percent said it was because nbsp they had to focus on their other children. and when it comes to that last point, nbsp about already having kids a 2021 nbsp nbsp review by the cdc looked at data nbsp from over half a million abortions, nbsp nbsp and found that sixty percent of nbsp those patients were already parents. someone might also have multiple nbsp reasons for getting an abortion. and some of them might have nothing to do with nbsp finances, family, or their living situation. notably, some people including about 110 women nbsp from that turnaway study sought abortions for nbsp nbsp medical reasons. they might have a health nbsp condition that makes pregnancy dangerous nbsp nbsp for them, or problems might come up during the nbsp pregnancy that affect them, the fetus, or both. so, there are a lot of variables here nbsp and there can be a lot of emotions. nbsp nbsp these are often complicated, heavy nbsp decisions. and while the data shows nbsp nbsp that most abortions are to end unintended nbsp pregnancies, that isn t always the case. one 2015 study reported that about four nbsp percent of abortions in the u.s. end a nbsp nbsp pregnancy that was intentional nbsp but had medical complications. teen shan i see what you mean about the nbsp whole there s no short answer thing. mhmm, exactly. when it comes to mental health, nbsp surveys have found that getting an abortion nbsp nbsp affects different people in different ways. nbsp you might notice a trend happening here. nbsp nbsp and this is also something that researchers nbsp from the turnaway study have looked into. as a part of that larger project, they nbsp recruited more than 600 women who d nbsp nbsp received abortions. and with their permission, nbsp they called them twice a year for five years, nbsp nbsp to ask what emotions they were nbsp feeling about their decision. overall, the team found that no nbsp matter how the women felt at first, nbsp nbsp nearly everyone s emotions both positive and nbsp negative were less intense after two years. and after half a decade, at least nbsp ninety-seven percent of women nbsp nbsp reported that getting an abortion nbsp was the right decision for them, nbsp nbsp even if they also said it had been nbsp a hard decision to make at the time. as a reminder, though, while data can shed some nbsp light on how a group of people can feel, and nbsp nbsp can be great for understanding the big picture, nbsp it also can t tell you how everyone will feel. like, in the turnaway study, about half of the nbsp women said that deciding to have an abortion nbsp nbsp was very or somewhat difficult and the other nbsp half reported that it wasn t a hard decision. like we ve said, every pregnancy, nbsp and every person, is unique. now, when it comes to abortion access at nbsp the time we re filming this, in october 2024, nbsp nbsp the legal situation in the u.s. is complicated. with a case called roe v. wade, the nbsp supreme court ruled in the 1970s nbsp nbsp that the constitution protected nbsp a person s right to an abortion. but that ruling was overturned in 2022, and now, nbsp nbsp abortion access is largely up to individual nbsp states. and even when laws aren t in limbo, it s also something activists nbsp and your local politicians, nbsp nbsp and your neighbors, and your third cousin nbsp on instagram are often vocal about. with all these beliefs swirling around, nbsp you might ve heard that there's two camps when it comes to abortion those nbsp who argue that abortion should be banned, nbsp nbsp and those who argue that legal nbsp abortion should be available. but if you dig into the research, what people nbsp actually think about abortion is much more nbsp nbsp complex, because it sits right at the crossroads nbsp of law, philosophy, religion, and science. kind of like how cats find a way to sit nbsp right in the middle of whatever you re doing. since 1995, the pew research center has kept nbsp track of data on what americans think about nbsp nbsp abortion. and while those numbers nbsp have varied a bit over the years, nbsp nbsp the number of americans who think nbsp abortion should be legal in all or nbsp nbsp most cases is usually above fifty percent. nbsp as of 2024, it was sixty-three percent. teen shan wait, what does nbsp all or some cases mean way to think critically about data, teen shan so in 2022, the folks at pew nbsp dug a little deeper into this, nbsp nbsp and found there s a lot going on under nbsp that all or most cases umbrella. things like how long a woman has been pregnant, nbsp nbsp whether the pregnancy threatens her health, and nbsp the circumstances of how she got pregnant like, nbsp nbsp whether or not the sex was consensual nbsp or not affected a lot of people s answers. overall, only about nineteen percent nbsp of participants supported the idea that nbsp nbsp abortion should be legal in all cases, and nbsp eight percent said it should be illegal in nbsp nbsp all cases. but a whopping seventy-one percent nbsp answered with some version of it depends. here s where that leaves us today. nbsp abortion will continue to be debated, nbsp nbsp and attitudes and laws will keep evolving, nbsp too. we hope this data about what happens nbsp nbsp and why helps you understand this nbsp big, complex topic a little better. next time, we re talking nbsp about consent. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed nbsp was produced in partnership with the nbsp nbsp kinsey institute at indiana university. nbsp if you are interested in learning more, nbsp nbsp visit their website for resources that explore nbsp the topics we discussed in the video today. thank you for watching this episode, which nbsp was filmed at our studio in indianapolis, nbsp nbsp and was made with the

united states, doesn t exist. let me explain. the members of the chinook indian nbsp nation were skilled fishers, using nets called seines to rein in salmon they would often use for trade. they honored the first salmon nbsp run of the year with rituals, nbsp where they cooked and ate the fish before returning their bones to the columbia river in what s now oregon and washington state. in fact, the chinook still nbsp practice the first salmon ceremony. nbsp their culture is alive and well. but to the u.s. federal government there is no chinook indian nation. hi, i m che jim and welcome to crash course native american history. theme music five hundred seventy-four. that s how many federally nbsp recognized native nations nbsp exist today in what s now nbsp known as the united states. and knowing that can feel a bit disorienting. nbsp i mean, that s more than ten nbsp times the number of u.s. states. wouldn t it make more sense to just nbsp call them tribes, instead of nations it s not wrong to say tribe, and many native folks use the two words interchangeably. but there s a good reason to nbsp use nation in this episode. we say nations when talking nbsp about the relationship nbsp between tribal governments and the united states because of what they have in nbsp common, and that s sovereignty an inherent, pre-existing right to govern themselves and their territory. meaning, essentially, to make nbsp and enforce their own laws. sovereignty is the basis of a nbsp government-to-government relationship, nbsp like the one between the u.s. and mexico. it s how treaties get interpreted, nbsp supreme court cases get decided, nbsp laws get legislated, and policies get policied and you really can t understand native history or the present, for that matter without first understanding what nbsp sovereignty means in action. native nations like the nbsp chinook were running themselves nbsp long before the united states existed. in fact, the chinook fed and nbsp sheltered lewis and clark nbsp when they came a-surveying nbsp the land that was not theirs. so sovereignty isn t something nbsp the u.s. ever gave these nations. the u.s. recognizes tribal sovereignty, which didn t just end with colonization. it s right there in the constitution, nbsp in a totally chill bit called nbsp the indian commerce clause colonial carl the congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, nbsp and among the several states, nbsp and with the indian tribes. record scratch che did you catch it it s subtle. but by saying congress can regulate trade with other sovereign governments, it s acknowledging that native nbsp nations are among those governments. and they ll be treated that way. not as special-interest groups. not as random individuals. but as equally sovereign nations. and if that wasn t enough, spoiler it definitely wasn t enough the government formally nbsp recognized native sovereignty nbsp again in the early 1800s, nbsp with the marshall trilogy. which sounds like a sci-fi franchise, but it s actually a series of supreme court cases that say the federal government, not the states, makes the policies about native nations. i'm lookin at you georgia - nbsp don't make me come down there. the grand finale of the marshall trilogy, nbsp worcester v. georgia in 1832, nbsp brought us this classic colonial carl tribes are distinct, nbsp nbsp independent, political communities, retaining their original natural nbsp rights, as the undisputed nbsp possessors of the soil, from time immemorial. che got a real ring to it. but the same case that recognized native sovereignty also reined it in, by classifying tribes as nbsp domestic dependent nations. domestic meaning they re nbsp within the borders of the u.s., dependent because the federal government has nbsp both responsibility toward nbsp them and power over them, and nations because that inherent right to govern themselves never actually went away. and if you re thinking, wow, that sounds like a completely unique, complicated, and contradictory pretzel of a situation yes, hello, welcome. it is. the whole domestic dependent nations thing nbsp made native sovereignty look nbsp more like quasi-sovereignty . congress now had plenary nbsp power over native nations, nbsp or the broad ability to limit nbsp or enhance tribal authority. they could basically decide if the u.s. government nbsp would treat native tribes as nations nbsp or not, on a case-by-case basis. and that had big consequences for the chinook who i mentioned earlier along with many nbsp nbsp other tribes. remember, tribal sovereignty is an inherent right. so the chinook were never not sovereign. but they needed federal recognition in order to actually act as a sovereign nation. but one thing that can help a nbsp tribe s case for federal recognition nbsp is if they entered into a treaty with the u.s. which several chinook tribes did in 1851. these treaties were overseen by the oregon superintendent of indian affairs and then shipped off to the senate and tabled. that congressional dismissal would be a major factor in the long fight for recognition of the chinook indian nation s sovereignty. and congress s power doesn t stop there. they can also terminate a nation s federally nbsp recognized status and with it nbsp their ability to self-govern. which happened to the nbsp chinook when they were listed nbsp as one of the terminated federal tribes in the western oregon indian termination act, which took effect in 1956. we ll talk much more about nbsp termination later in this series. as processes for federal recognition nbsp changed over the decades, nbsp the chinook tried and failed to gain theirs back. and between 2001 and 2002, they were even successful, on the basis that one of the nbsp treaties had been ratified. but george w. bush s administration reversed that decision just after eighteen months. it was a huge loss for the tribe but not the end of their fight for recognition. so why is tribal sovereignty such a big deal well, in the united states today, native nations, the federal government, and the states are the only three political nbsp entities that have sovereignty. being recognized by the federal government means native nations can make their own laws and govern their own citizens. and they can set their own rules nbsp for who s considered a citizen. recognized sovereignty also means native nations can enforce their own laws and run their own court systems. they can police their own borders nbsp and regulate trade within them, which can create jobs and drive economic growth. native nations can also provide services geared toward the welfare of their citizens, like healthcare and first responders. like, the federal government nbsp funds the indian health service, which provided vaccines during the nbsp early days of the covid-19 pandemic. but members of non-federally recognized nations, nbsp like the chinook, don t have full nbsp access to the ihs or its resources. so some tribal members had to nbsp travel hours to get vaccinated. and importantly, federally recognized nations have authority over how their lands get used. a lot of tribal lands are owned by the federal government and held in trust for the tribe, but tribes themselves have the final word on much of what happens to those lands and states can t meddle in the matter. and this includes things like hunting, nbsp fishing, and gathering rights. without federal recognition, the chinook don t have clear fishing rights to the salmon that are such a big part of nbsp their culture and history. that means they have to pay for nbsp fishing licenses just like anyone else, nbsp even though they have an nbsp ancestral connection to the fish. recognized sovereignty also means being able to collect taxes from tribal citizens, and non-citizens conducting nbsp business on tribal lands. states can t tax native nations or tribal members, but in a strange loophole, if a non-indian buys a coffee at a tribal-owned gas station, the state can collect sales nbsp taxes off that purchase. isn t the legal system fun by and large, recognized sovereignty means native nations can handle their own business, without interference from the states. but native nations and states nbsp sometimes enter into agreements, nbsp government-to-government, to nbsp work together on certain issues. like, if a nation wants to open a casino, they have to enter into a compact with the state where that casino will be located. or if the child of an enrolled tribal nbsp member needs to enter foster care, nbsp the nation and the state nbsp will often share resources. at the end of the day, nbsp sovereignty means native nations are better able to pass on their traditions, maintain their cultural identities, preserve their languages, and determine their own futures. and without federal recognition, all of that becomes a whole lot harder. but even when the federal government acknowledges a tribe s sovereignty, it can still have a lot of control. state laws may not be enforced in indian country. but congress can give states nbsp some power over tribal affairs, nbsp in ways that diminish native sovereignty. and it s done so before without consulting native nations first. for example, in 1953, congress nbsp enacted public law 280, which gave state law enforcement control nbsp they didn t previously have nbsp on native lands in six states alaska, california, minnesota, nebraska, oregon, and wisconsin. before that, native nations handled nbsp minor crimes on reservations, nbsp and the federal government nbsp dealt with any major crimes. but after pl 280 passed again, without native consent the nations suddenly shared criminal nbsp jurisdiction with the state, nbsp which limited tribes authority nbsp to deal with minor crimes. on top of that, native nations nbsp in those states were suddenly nbsp disqualified from federal nbsp funding to run their own courts. it s that congressional power nbsp to rein in native governance nbsp that makes their sovereignty a bit of a gray area. even though federally recognized nbsp tribes are sovereign nations nbsp they can t do a lot of the things nbsp we d associate with nations. like, the navajo nation cannot go to war, nbsp sign an international trade nbsp treaty, or make its own currency. and the u.s. has a habit of disrespecting the sovereignty that native nations do have. both before and after the constitution recognized nbsp tribal sovereignty, colonists nbsp and the u.s. government actively undermined it by killing nbsp and displacing native people, nbsp taking native land, and trying to get nbsp rid of native cultures altogether. as we ll see throughout this series, that lack of respect for tribal sovereignty had some dire consequences for native people that we re still dealing with today. so where does that leave us and where does it leave the chinook indian nation well, in 2017, the chinook nbsp filed a suit against the nbsp department of the interior and nbsp the bureau of indian affairs claiming that they deserved nbsp to be federally acknowledged. but, as of this filming in nbsp 2024, it hasn t happened yet. the chinook indian nation is still pursuing every pathway it can to regain their recognition. regardless of recognition, nbsp the right of native nations nbsp to govern themselves has nbsp existed since time immemorial. it wasn t a gift the u.s. gave to these tribes. it s something that native nations already had an inherent right that didn t cease to exist when their lands were colonized. and today, native sovereignty is the basis of a government-to-government relationship, a nation-within-a-nation situation that is to say the least complicated. we ll keep exploring it a whole nbsp lot more throughout this series. next time, we ll talk about some of the scariest myths and misconceptions about native americans. and i ll see

yanktonai history. each picture represents a notable nbsp event between first snowfalls. but this is just a snippet nbsp of a much larger timeline. every tribe has one a history that s deep, ongoing, and totally unique. and yet they re all unified by one thing. hi i'm che jim and welcome to crash course native american history. theme music first things first there s no way we can tell the entire history of indigenous people in what s now the united states. but that doesn t mean we can t bridge some gaps nbsp and add a little complexity nbsp to common understandings. maybe we ll even go crazy and nbsp fix some misunderstandings. studies have shown that, across nbsp the board in u.s. schools, students aren t getting much of an education when it comes to native american history not by a long shot. as one navajo hopi student wrote in 2019, ... of the u.s. history nbsp books used in my classroom, nbsp there are 307 pages and only nbsp 10 pages talk about natives. so yeah, this will be hard. and we won t cover everything. but we ll cover a lot of things. we hope to help answer some big questions, leave you curious about others, and really blow your hair nbsp back with facts about how nbsp native history has shaped our world today. so let s start with a word on words. there are over five hundred native tribes, also called nations, within the u.s. alone. some are recognized by the federal nbsp government, and some aren t. i m a member of the navajo nation not to brag. but even that simple statement nbsp has layers of nuance. we call ourselves din , which nbsp means the people. navajo is a name that came nbsp about thanks to europeans. some din folks use the term nbsp navajo others prefer not to. nbsp it s a to each their own situation. throughout this series, i ll use nbsp specific native nations names. so, if i m talking about the kickapoo nbsp or the hualapai or the chickahominy, nbsp you ll hear me say so with nbsp perfect pronunciation, to boot. okay, i ll try my best. and i ll use the word native. like, a lot. i might say native folks or native people. but i ll also say indigenous. that s the broadest term for nbsp people worldwide who ve been nbsp living in a particular place nbsp since before settlers arrived. like for example, in the nbsp u.s., the aleut, the chumash, nbsp and the kanaka maoli all indigenous. but the s mi in places like norway, the maya in places like mexico and guatemala, and the ainu in japan are also all indigenous. in that way, we re kind of like cousins. not by blood more by vibes. you ll also sometimes hear me say american indian nbsp a label that some indigenous nbsp people embrace, and others reject. pro it s been around for a long time. it s used in u.s. laws, nbsp treaties, even the names of nbsp federal agencies like the nbsp bureau of indian affairs. indian is also just a term nbsp older native people like to use, nbsp especially around other native people. con this. is not. india. buddy another con even though any native could self-identify as an american indian, it doesn't officially nbsp include all indigenous people. that s because the government nbsp only applies the term nbsp to members of federally recognized native nations in the contiguous 48 states, but not alaska natives or native hawaiians. we ll talk a lot more about what it nbsp means to have federal recognition, nbsp as well as the status of natives in nbsp alaska and hawaii, later in the series. for now, let s end this vocabulary nbsp lesson with native american. this term came about in the 1960s, as an alternative to american indian. it s gained a lot of ground as a go-to option. but native american has its own issues like, the americas are all of this business. maybe even this possibly this too, but now we re getting wild of course, this term isn t preferred everywhere. in canada, many indigenous people prefer to be called first nations or first peoples, one of three categories alongside inuit and m tis. in spanish-speaking latin nbsp america, many prefer ind genas. so native american isn t perfect. but it broadly describes nbsp indigenous people within the u.s. at the end of the day, how natives nbsp choose to identify is very personal i call myself indigenous. i also call myself handsome and brave, nbsp every morning in front of the mirror. every indigenous person has their own preferences when it comes to identity. though for the record, you re nbsp all brave and handsome. mumbles just not as much as me. the point is, there are no definitive rules on indigenous terminology there couldn t be like, remember how i said there are hundreds of native nations inside the u.s. alone well, even that s complicated about forty native nations today have territories split in half by the u.s. border. like the kanyen'keh ka, or mohawk nbsp nation of awkwesasne to the north. or the tohono o odham nation to the south. and many, many, many native nbsp nations like the ho-chunk were forced away from their ancestral homelands, and live in a totally different region today. but, with just 24 episodes, we needed to narrow down so we had room to go deep. so, that s why we ll be focusing mainly on nbsp the history of native nbsp peoples in the united states. and that s why we re calling the nbsp series native american history. i fought for the name a brave and handsome history of native america but i was not successful. which brings me to the paradox at the nbsp heart of native american history. on the one hand, there are tons of native nations with their own unique histories their own timelines there is no single history that we nbsp can call native american history. on the other hand, native nations nbsp share some common experiences, nbsp though they ve happened in nbsp different ways, times, and places. those common experiences are a nbsp result of settler-colonialism, nbsp a force that binds native histories together. remember back in the intro when i said that there s one thing that unites our histories this is that thing let me break it down. we ll start with colonialism nbsp that s where one nation nbsp exerts control over another nbsp nation and its resources without becoming part of that nation themselves. for example, colonialism describes what happened nbsp when the british took over nbsp nigeria in the 19th century, ruling indirectly through local nbsp leaders and getting rich off palm oil. nigerians still lived there, but nbsp their lives were never the same. the settler part takes this a step beyond. the goal of settler-colonialism is to remove and erase the people already living in a place, so that a new group can move in instead. and this isn t just describing a nbsp single historical event or person. but yes, i m talking about you. settler-colonialism describes a system. and the history of the whole united nbsp states was shaped by this system. it s the underlying logic behind nbsp centuries of wars, treaties, nbsp policies, and laws that affect nbsp native peoples lives to this day. that system is part of the reason why basically any question that seems simple nbsp is going to be complicated like, take this one how many nbsp native americans are there well, before settlers arrived in north america, nbsp nobody here called themselves nbsp indian or a native american. those categories didn t exist we were kind of just living our lives. but in the 19th century, the federal government created a new, single native identity, lumping all native people nbsp together as a single race . suddenly, in the words of high school musical s troy bolton, we were all in this together. the government created records of tribal members and assigned each person a blood quantum, or perceived fraction of indian blood. freaky-sounding term, right the idea was that, over time, nbsp children born to native families nbsp would have lower and lower blood quantums. thinking of indian blood as something that could be diluted down to zero over generations served the goal of eliminating native people. first so their land could be taken, and second, nbsp to eventually relieve the federal government of its treaty and trust obligations to natives. but hi hello we re still here plan failed as of the 2020 u.s. census, nbsp nbsp about 9.7 million people or 2.9 percent of the population self-identified as american nbsp indian or alaska native. though this, too, is wait for it complicated. it s not clear how many of those nbsp people were enrolled tribal members, nbsp members of tribes the federal nbsp government doesn t recognize, or even just people who ve nbsp heard family stories about nbsp their great-great grandma nbsp being a cherokee princess. settlers have such big imaginations. anyway, we ll talk much more about nbsp native identity in episode 4. for now, let s talk about what we mean by the history part of native american history. the past five centuries have had an nbsp enormous impact on native nations. but also the past five centuries are just a blip about twenty generations we often use the phrase since time immemorial or the beginning of time itself to describe natives deep and nbsp ongoing presence on this continent. we re the descendants of the first inhabitants. we ve been here continuously nbsp for thousands of years. don t make me math the math on nbsp how many generations that is. but when native american history does get told, nbsp it s usually in a way that begins nbsp in 1492 and ends in the late 1800s. which might give you the impression that history didn t really begin until europeans showed up. or that what happened before is unknowable. or that native americans are mere extras in an a-list drama of the united states, and we mysteriously vanished by the 20th century, only a brief blurb on the nation s imdb page. but nah, none of those things are true. again hi hello still here we made it the past before european nbsp contact is not unknowable. native peoples oral traditions nbsp hold knowledge of the past. like, for generations, the klamath nbsp people have passed down a story nbsp about a long-ago volcano that nbsp erupted and filled with water, becoming what s now crater lake. and this memory of an ancient eruption it happened 7,600 years ago. that was about 1500 years before anyone even started building stonehenge. our ancestors were very skilled at gossip. even gossip about volcanoes. which is why we ll include nbsp stuff that happened before 1492. we ll talk about the creation stories, worldviews, and connections to place, food, and ancestors that are thousands of years old nbsp and that still endure today, nbsp despite settlers best efforts to wipe them out. and we ll also talk about how the nbsp settlers impact has persisted nbsp beyond the 1800s and continues to play out today. often, you ll catch me talking about last year and hundreds of years ago in the same breath. because the past and the present are connected. way closer than you might think. all wound together, like nbsp braids, or dna, or twizzlers. cause when native american nbsp history doesn t get told, the general public underestimates the ongoing impacts of colonization and discrimination. native people get written out of nbsp the past and the present, too. but it s time for that to end. because without native american history, there would be no u.s. history. the u.s. isn t even the nbsp oldest democracy around here nbsp i see you, haudenosaunee confederacy. native american history is nbsp more than a single story. it s hundreds of timelines nbsp across hundreds of nations. each with their own unique experiences, histories, nbsp languages, traditions, and nbsp relationships with each other. we re still here, connected in ways that transcend the attempts to erase us. and we re shaping what happens next whether this guy s ghost likes it or not. ghost of colonial carl i do not actually. che i don t care. in our next episode, we ll nbsp talk about something else nbsp every native nation has in common sovereignty. i ll see you then. thanks for watching this episode of crash course native american history which was filmed at our studio nbsp in indianapolis, indiana nbsp and was made with the help nbsp of all these nice people. if you want to help keep crash nbsp course free for

to give, nbsp say hello to hormonal methods they re ready to be your emergency nbsp contact let s call up emergency methods they are ready to commit, give nbsp a warm welcome to permanent methods teen shan nbsp what s supposed to be over there game show host shan oh, that's the male birth nbsp control pill. it hasn t shown up yet. fake audience gasps hi, i m shan boodram, this is crash course sex ed, nbsp nbsp and today we re talking about nbsp how to not get pregnant. yeah. applause we ll be right back after these messages. theme music a quick note on language we ll mostly refer nbsp to cisgender men and women in this episode, nbsp nbsp because that s where most of nbsp the research has been done. but trans men and nonbinary people can and nbsp do get pregnant, and male birth control is nbsp nbsp just as important for trans women, nbsp as iuds and pills are for trans men. regardless of the genders involved, nbsp it takes two to make a pregnancy. one limited edition egg, and nbsp one tiny, tail-wagging sperm. contraception is all about finding nbsp ways to make sure these two never meet. or those two. or those two. yeah, nbsp there s a lot of sperm up in here. the typical ejaculation releases nearly nbsp two to three hundred million of them. and keeping all those swimmers nbsp away from an egg is no easy task. so, how do you do it teen shan nadine s cousin s neighbor told me to just make sure the guy nbsp pulls out before he y know. oh yeah, i do remember hearing that, teen shan. well, more clinically, that s called withdrawal. during p-in-v sex, someone removes nbsp their penis before ejaculation, nbsp nbsp so the semen goes somewhere nbsp outside their partner s vagina. but there s a reason it s often nbsp called pull out and pray. for one, a guy has to pull out in time. and also, it s still possible for nbsp sperm to be in the pre-ejaculate, nbsp nbsp the stuff that comes out before semen, nbsp especially if he didn't pee before sex. so all said, pulling out can have nbsp a one in five chance of failure. big picture, withdrawal is what nbsp we d call a natural method. the other big one is fertility awareness. sometimes called the rhythm method, it involves nbsp a woman tracking and recording her temperature, nbsp nbsp cervical mucus, or menstrual cycle nbsp to predict which days she s fertile nbsp nbsp and should avoid sex, or at least use a condom. we ll talk more about the nbsp fertile window in episode 9. according to sources like the uk s national health nbsp service, fertility awareness can be effective. but if it s not done perfectly, there s nbsp about a one in four chance of failure. this method is difficult to get right, nbsp nbsp and it s much tougher if someone s nbsp period isn t regular or easily tracked. for something more reliable, nbsp there s barrier methods. they re anything that blocks sperm from the goal, nbsp nbsp like the ever-popular, nbsp always-put-on-a-banana condom. seriously, condom demonstrations nbsp ruined bananas for me. anyway, barrier methods come in two types nbsp nbsp the external kind that rolls on to a nbsp penis and traps sperm-filled semen. and the internal kind, which does exactly nbsp the same thing, but sits inside a vagina. condoms are pretty cheap, at most nbsp pharmacies, and when used correctly, nbsp nbsp highly effective at preventing pregnancy nbsp and sexually transmitted infections. if you always use one perfectly, the nbsp world health organization estimates nbsp nbsp that external condoms are about ninety-eight nbsp percent effective at preventing pregnancies, nbsp nbsp while that number for internal nbsp condoms is about ninety-five percent. teen shan what about the pill i nbsp heard nadine s older sister is on it. yep, birth control pills are another nbsp popular type of contraception. the pill s an example of a hormonal nbsp method, which also includes patches, nbsp nbsp shots, implants, and many intrauterine devices, or iuds. hormonal methods block ovulation, that time nbsp once a month when an ovary releases an egg. two hormones progestin and sometimes nbsp estrogen can stop ovulation from happening. and they can also make the mucus nbsp around the cervix super-sticky, nbsp nbsp so sperm have a harder time wiggling through. these methods are impermanent but highly effective nbsp nbsp for a specific amount of time from nbsp twenty-four hours to almost a decade. but not every method works right away. it can take as long as a week for it to nbsp become fully effective, depending on the type. unlike barrier methods, hormonal nbsp methods do have side effects, nbsp nbsp which can vary from person to person, and nbsp include things like nausea or headaches. most go away after about three months, but this nbsp also varies between people and between methods. also, almost all hormonal nbsp options require a doctor s visit. the exception is the mini-pill, which contains nbsp only progestin and can be bought over the counter. the mini-pill does have some slightly different nbsp risks than the combined pill, though, so like with nbsp nbsp any of these methods, we highly recommend learning nbsp more before deciding what s right for you. now, i can not emphasize enough how huge nbsp a deal it was when the birth control pill nbsp nbsp became widely available in nbsp the mid-twentieth century. creating it was a decades-long nbsp journey. but unfortunately, some really harmful ideas guided its development. in the 1920s and 30s, the movement to develop nbsp birth control in the u.s. became all tangled up nbsp nbsp with eugenics, the false belief that humans nbsp could be improved by keeping certain groups nbsp nbsp of people including immigrants, disabled nbsp folks, and people of color from having kids. this is civil rights activist fannie lou hamer. in 1961, she had surgery to remove a uterine nbsp tumor, but woke to find that her doctor had nbsp nbsp performed a hysterectomy her entire uterus nbsp had been removed without her consent. this meant she could never get pregnant. hamer was just one of more than seventy thousand nbsp people in the u.s. mostly black, latina, nbsp nbsp and native women who were sterilized against nbsp their will under eugenics-inspired policies. in fact, this practice became nbsp so common among black women in nbsp nbsp the south that hamer dubbed it nbsp a mississippi appendectomy. this was the kind of environment the nbsp birth control pill was developed in. before the fda approved the first pill, nbsp called enovid, a version that contained nbsp nbsp more hormones and could have much stronger side nbsp effects was tested on women in puerto rico, nbsp nbsp who weren t warned of the risks or even told nbsp they were taking part in a clinical trial. three women died in the process. the prescription pill eventually hit nbsp the market in 1957, which allowed nbsp nbsp many women unprecedented control over nbsp their reproductive decision-making. but as revolutionary as that was, it came from a nbsp nbsp legacy of women whose reproductive nbsp control was taken away from them. over the decades, new brands of the nbsp pill and new varieties of long-acting, nbsp nbsp reversible contraceptives or nbsp larcs have been developed. these are set it and forget nbsp it options that someone can nbsp nbsp stop using whenever they want to get pregnant. and in 2024, the first over-the-counter birth nbsp control pill in the u.s. became available. but when it comes to hormonal methods nbsp like the pill, women often carry most nbsp nbsp of the responsibility for not getting pregnant. so, why isn t there a male birth control pill one reason it doesn t exist yet is because the nbsp nbsp bar to prove a contraceptive is safe nbsp is higher today than it was in 1960. good it should be but then there s a less-good reason there s not nbsp the same sense of urgency to develop a male pill. women have traditionally been responsible for nbsp reproduction, and they already have options. some researchers also say it s been harder nbsp to lock down the hormone levels that can nbsp nbsp disarm millions of sperm without nbsp risking a lot of side effects. like, in a 2011 trial, shots nbsp of two hormones progestin and nbsp nbsp testosterone were found to be really nbsp good at stopping sperm production. but the trial was cut off because of side effects nbsp like severe acne, mood swings, and weight gain. teen shan wait, aren t those like the same nbsp side effects that women can have from the pill they are. but for women, ethics nbsp committees are comparing the nbsp nbsp side effects from the pill against the nbsp health risks of carrying a pregnancy. so, these side effects are deemed acceptable. for cis men, they re comparing the side nbsp effects of those shots against well, nothing. so, the shots don t get the green light. still, there s been some recent nbsp progress toward a male pill. in 2023, researchers discovered a chemical nbsp compound that stops sperms tails from wagging, nbsp nbsp so they can t swim far enough to fertilize an egg. but don t break out the condom balloons yet nbsp this compound has only been studied in mice. and there s a long road ahead before nbsp it s part of a male contraceptive. as of 2024, there is a male birth control pill nbsp that's in early phases of clinical trials, nbsp nbsp and there s also a male birth control gel nbsp that's a bit further along in its testing the gel uses both progestin nbsp and testosterone so that men nbsp nbsp using it don t produce enough nbsp sperm to get someone pregnant. and to apply it, they just nbsp rub it on their shoulders. okay that sounds promising. alright, nbsp fine, we can blow up one condom balloon. so, today, we have natural methods, nbsp barrier methods, and hormonal methods. but what happens if one of those methods fail nbsp for that, there s emergency contraception. one type is the morning after pill, which can nbsp be accessed from a doctor, clinic, or pharmacy. it s most effective within nbsp 72 hours of unprotected sex, nbsp nbsp and it has to be taken within five nbsp days to have any chance of working. some types of emergency contraception are nbsp available over the counter in the u.s., nbsp nbsp so you don t need a prescription. and that one pill works for one nbsp instance of unprotected sex. it s a misconception that using the nbsp morning after pill multiple times will nbsp nbsp cause fertility issues or other health problems. but it also isn t meant to be your primary mode of nbsp nbsp contraception because it s not nbsp as effective as other methods. certain kinds of iuds can also be nbsp used as emergency contraception. they can block sperm from meeting up with nbsp an egg if they re inserted within five days nbsp nbsp of unprotected sex, and they continue nbsp to offer protection for years to come but you need to see a doctor for insertion, nbsp nbsp and it s not always easy to get nbsp an appointment on short notice. now if you really don t want to have kids like, nbsp ever for that, there s permanent birth control. for anyone with a uterus, this surgical nbsp procedure is often called getting your nbsp nbsp tubes tied, but really it involves either closing nbsp nbsp or removing pieces of the fallopian nbsp tubes, or taking them out altogether. a hysterectomy also falls in this category. for penises, you ve got the vasectomy. it involves surgically cutting nbsp or blocking the vasa deferentia nbsp nbsp the little tubes that carry nbsp sperm out of the testicles. so you still ejaculate, but the semen is nbsp spermless and can t get anybody pregnant. both types of permanent birth control are highly nbsp effective, but there is a risk of complications. also, many people especially women nbsp have found that doctors can be reluctant nbsp nbsp to perform the procedures, citing things nbsp like risks and the possibility of regret. when it comes to contraception, there s nbsp a lot going on here we may not have male nbsp nbsp birth control pills yet, but there nbsp are still some options for everyone. and if you re curious about any of the nbsp methods we talked about, the best things nbsp nbsp you can do are talk to a doctor and research nbsp contraceptive methods at the links below. get curious, and you ll find the answers and nbsp the options that work best for you. next time, we re talking nbsp pregnancy and birth. see you then. but first, here s what nbsp nbsp you ve all been waiting for how to use a condom. before opening the package, make sure it s intact nbsp nbsp by feeling for the air bubble, nbsp and check that expiration date. now, carefully open the condom nbsp package, just like this. take the condom out. you re going to hold it like this, so it looks nbsp like a cute little hat, and place it on the head nbsp nbsp of the erect penis, pulling back any foreskin, nbsp if there is any, or you can place it on a toy. if you accidentally put it on inside-out, nbsp you gotta get a whole new condom otherwise, nbsp nbsp there could be pre-ejaculate on it, which nbsp can contain sperm, bacteria, or viruses. then, with one hand, pinch the air out of the nbsp top, keeping that little tip above the head. that s where the semen s gonna go. with the other hand, unroll the nbsp whole condom onto the penis, nbsp nbsp checking that it s snug, but not too tight. and make sure you ve got the condom on from nbsp the start of sex all the way to the end. after sex is over, while the penis is still hard, nbsp hold onto the rim of the condom, then pull out. then carefully take it off and throw it away. nbsp look at you you just practiced safer sex. this episode of crash course sex

sexually transmitted infections. no nbsp nbsp disease is ever fun, and they can be even nbsp less fun when they have to do with sex. but actually stis are avoidable, nbsp treatable, and preventable. so let s cover the facts. because just a few nbsp nbsp key pieces of information can nbsp help you have a safer sex life. hi i'm shan boodram and nbsp this is crash course sex ed. theme music where there are humans, there are germs. nbsp we sneeze, we get our hands dirty, and sometimes, we get sexually nbsp transmitted infections, or stis, nbsp nbsp which are infections that can be nbsp spread through sexual contact. in fact, in 2018 the cdc estimated nbsp that over sixty-seven million people nbsp nbsp in the u.s. had an sti, with about nbsp twenty million new cases every year. and almost half of those new cases showed up nbsp nbsp in people between the ages nbsp of fifteen and twenty-four. when it comes to stis, there are a lot nbsp of myths out there. here s a big one nbsp nbsp stis are so common because nbsp they re hard to prevent and treat. actually, most are pretty easy to avoid, but nbsp many people just don t know how to prevent them. and most are also easy to treat. for the few nbsp that aren t curable, there are options to nbsp nbsp minimize their impact on your life and make sure nbsp you don t pass them on. so, let s get into it. most stis can be put into one of nbsp two categories bacterial or viral. the most common bacterial stis are nbsp gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. they re spread through bodily fluids or nbsp nbsp direct contact with a rash or nbsp sore during unprotected sex. and by fluids, i don t just mean semen depending on the sti, fluids can also mean nbsp vaginal fluids, preejaculate, or saliva, and these can be exchanged nbsp nbsp through penetration, oral sex, anal sex, sex toys, nbsp or even just rubbing genitals against each other. luckily, we ve got a highly effective solution nbsp nbsp wrap it up. no, not that kind of nbsp wrap. this kind of wrap. thank you. one of the easiest ways to avoid catching an nbsp sti is to use a barrier method of protection, nbsp nbsp which prevents direct contact. like external condoms for penises, internal nbsp condoms that go inside a vagina or anus, nbsp nbsp and dental dams, which can be placed over a nbsp vulva or an anus before engaging in oral sex. and because sex toys can also nbsp spread bacteria and stis, nbsp nbsp it s important to clean those after every use, nbsp usually with hot water and antibacterial soap. condoms can also help make them safer, nbsp especially with new or multiple partners. but while barrier methods are really nbsp good at preventing stis, they re not nbsp nbsp perfect they can malfunction, nbsp and there can be user error. that s why sti testing and nbsp open dialogue among partners nbsp nbsp is so important. you can even make it flirty show me your results and i ll show you mine. now, if you do get a bacterial sti, there is nbsp a really effective cure for them antibiotics. there are even preventative antibiotics, like nbsp the one called doxycycline that someone can take nbsp nbsp up to seventy-two hours after a barrier nbsp method fails, or if they don t use one. but they re not meant to replace nbsp barrier methods. and at the time of nbsp nbsp recording this video, doxycycline is only nbsp recommended for cis-men and transwomen. as for when to seek treatment sometimes, it s nbsp clear that something is up down there pain, nbsp nbsp unusual discharge, sores, or even flu-like nbsp symptoms with syphilis in particular. but there s also this other myth floating around nbsp nbsp that if you don t have any symptoms, you nbsp don t need to worry about having an sti. here s the truth, though nbsp most stis are asymptomatic, nbsp nbsp meaning someone might not notice nbsp having any symptoms at all. teen shan so i could get nbsp an sti and not even know it mhmm. that s why it s so important to get nbsp tested regularly, especially if you re having nbsp nbsp sex with multiple partners, or the person you re nbsp having sex with is having sex with other people. because even when someone isn t showing symptoms, nbsp nbsp they re still able to pass on nbsp the infection to someone else. and a long-term infection, nbsp even an asymptomatic one, nbsp nbsp can lead to irreversible damage nbsp to the reproductive organs. and hot tip don t just assume your doctor is nbsp nbsp testing you for stis if they nbsp take your blood or urine sample. if you want an sti test, you gotta ask for it. and if you don t feel like you can ask your nbsp regular doctor, you can check out your local nbsp nbsp department of health, planned parenthood, nbsp or another sti testing option near you. now, bacterial stis aren t the only ones out nbsp there. there are also stis caused by viruses. and unlike their bacterial nbsp cousins, viral stis can t be nbsp nbsp cured but medications can keep symptoms in check. the most common viral stis are nbsp herpes human papillomavirus, nbsp nbsp aka hpv hepatitis b and human nbsp immunodeficiency virus, or hiv. all of these can be transmitted through sexual nbsp contact with an infected person, so barrier nbsp nbsp methods are a key part of preventing them. nbsp but what does it look like if you do get one let s start with herpes. there are two kinds. hsv-1 usually causes cold sores on the mouth, nbsp nbsp while hsv-2 usually causes nbsp sores around the genitals. either way, the virus is most often nbsp transmitted by contact with sores, nbsp nbsp but it can also happen even when none are visible. once someone gets it, the nbsp herpes virus is there for keeps. it can go dormant for long periods nbsp of time and then pop back up in times nbsp nbsp of stress or when their immune nbsp system is otherwise compromised. so, folks with herpes won t always have nbsp sores but may experience recurrences. but even though herpes isn t curable, it nbsp is very treatable. there are prescription nbsp nbsp medications that can help manage flare-ups nbsp and put the infection back into dormancy. up next, there s hpv. unlike nbsp the two kinds of herpes, nbsp nbsp there are over two hundred different kinds of hpv. which sounds scary, but for nbsp the vast majority of people, nbsp nbsp their immune system will clear out nbsp an hpv infection pretty quickly. there are a few strains that can stick around nbsp and cause genital warts, and other strains can nbsp nbsp cause cells at the site of infection to nbsp behave in a way that can lead to cancer. high-risk hpv strains most commonly cause nbsp cervical cancer, but can also cause other cancers. the good news is, there s an hpv vaccine. and it s so effective that in nbsp places where it s been rolled out, nbsp nbsp researchers have seen drastic decreases in nbsp cervical cancer in the decades that followed. your doctor can give you more information nbsp on the vaccine if you re interested, nbsp nbsp or check your records to nbsp see if you already got it. and there s also a vaccine for hepatitis b, nbsp nbsp which is transmitted through fluids nbsp from unprotected sex or sharing needles. and speaking of life-saving science, here s nbsp a viral sti you might have heard about before hiv. this was once a deadly disease, nbsp but now it s considered a chronic, nbsp nbsp manageable illness for those who are able nbsp to access care and it can be prevented, too. hiv damages a person s immune system, nbsp making it hard to fight everyday infections, nbsp nbsp and it can sometimes lead to an nbsp ongoing condition called aids. although not everyone living nbsp with hiv develops aids. in the u.s., gay and bisexual men nbsp are the group most affected by hiv, nbsp nbsp but it can affect people nbsp of any sexual orientation, nbsp nbsp and be transmitted through many kinds of sex or nbsp no sex at all, like through an infected needle. that said, anal sex is significantly riskier nbsp for the transmission of hiv than vaginal sex. that s because anal and rectal tissue is thin, nbsp nbsp allowing the virus increased nbsp access to the bloodstream. while i can t stress enough how important condoms nbsp are, there s an added option for hiv prevention for people who are at higher risk of being nbsp exposed, their doctor can prescribe a medication nbsp nbsp called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or prep, which nbsp is taken as a daily pill or a bimonthly injection. when it s taken properly, prep reduces the risk nbsp nbsp of getting sexually transmitted nbsp hiv up to ninety-nine percent. there are also medications that can be taken nbsp if someone thinks they were exposed to hiv. if taken within seventy-two hours of nbsp contact, it can prevent infection. these are called post-exposure nbsp prophylaxis drugs, or pep. some people think that prep nbsp and pep are only for gay men, nbsp nbsp but that s not true stis do not nbsp discriminate based on sexual orientation. and if someone is hiv positive there nbsp are medications like antiretroviral nbsp nbsp therapy that can help them live a normal, healthy, nbsp nbsp and long life, and prevent them from nbsp passing the disease on to others. and scientists around the world are working nbsp hard to develop an effective hiv vaccine. unfortunately, though, there s still nbsp serious stigma around hiv in most cultures. that means medicines like prep and pep as well nbsp nbsp as programs to help people afford nbsp them may not be talked about. so, some people are speaking up to nbsp change that. teen shan, let em know. this is the famed, the fabulous, nbsp the ever-fashionable billy porter. he was diagnosed hiv-positive in 2007, and nbsp kept it private for more than a decade. in the religious family he grew up in, nbsp hiv was considered a punishment from god. and as an actor, there was a chance his nbsp disease would prevent him from getting work. but in 2021, he took his diagnosis public. nbsp there s no more stigma, he said in an interview. let s be done with that. and porter s joined by others nbsp with hiv in stopping the stigma, nbsp nbsp from nba star magic johnson, to nbsp queer eye host jonathan van ness. as van ness put it on social media, we have nbsp come a long way in the fight against hiv aids, nbsp nbsp but there is so much work left to be done. so, getting an sti doesn t have to be a world-shattering thing or nbsp something to be ashamed of. overall, understanding how to prevent nbsp stis, being aware of your own body, nbsp nbsp and communicating with your nbsp partners and your doctor are key. we re all just trying to help each other nbsp live our safest, healthiest sex lives. ooh speaking of prevention next time, we re nbsp talking about contraception. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was produced nbsp nbsp in partnership with the kinsey nbsp institute at indiana university. if you re interested in learning more, nbsp nbsp visit their website for resources that explore nbsp the topics we discussed in the video today. thank you for watching this episode, nbsp which was filmed at our studio nbsp

nope. nbsp clearly we need to get into this. gasps hi, i m shan boodram, this is crash course sex nbsp ed, and today we re talking about virginity nbsp nbsp is it really a thing we ll be nbsp back right after these messages. theme music when someone thinks virgin, their nbsp mind often goes to the only sex act nbsp nbsp that can make a baby penis-in-vagina. which is complicated, since that s nbsp not what all sex looks like, nbsp nbsp but it s where we ll camp out for today. nobody knows exactly when we nbsp started caring about virginity, nbsp nbsp but a leading theory is that it goes all nbsp the way back to the invention of farming. which sounds like i made it up, but nbsp i swear i m not messing with you. farming coincided with the invention of nbsp property. so suddenly, ownership mattered nbsp nbsp my land, my crops, my stuff and, hold nbsp on, which one of these kids is mine in these patriarchal societies, who s nbsp your daddy was an important question. and the only way for men to be sure about nbsp their biological dadhood was to invent nbsp nbsp a system where women were expected nbsp to reserve sex for their husbands. old macdonald had a farm... and nbsp control over his wife's sex life. over the centuries, virginity nbsp became a whole thing in the west, nbsp nbsp embedded in everything from artwork nbsp and religion to laws and teen movies. and premarital virginity became such a nbsp prized quality in women, people were like, nbsp nbsp no no no no, we can t just take her word for it. nbsp we need to prove that she s telling the truth. in 17th-century england, people theorized nbsp nbsp you could tell a virgin from nbsp the proportions of her neck. before that, in renaissance europe, it was thought nbsp nbsp that a virgin could be sussed out nbsp based on the clarity of her pee. and of course, virginity detectives nbsp have long honed in on the hymen. don t know her she s a thin membrane near nbsp the opening of the vagina. literally just some tissue left over after the nbsp vagina forms during fetal development. you may have heard that the hymen nbsp breaks like the seal on a jar the nbsp nbsp first time a person with a vagina has p-in-v sex. changing them physically forever. but it doesn t work like that. and it s nothing nbsp like popping a cherry, so let s just ban that nbsp nbsp phrase forever. some people with vaginas nbsp don t have much of a hymen to begin with. and for those who do, that tissue often thins nbsp away way before they re sexually active, nbsp nbsp from exercising, riding a bike, nbsp using a tampon, or just existing. many people never know their hymen s nbsp there, much less when it s gone. still, this myth is so globally pervasive that nbsp some parents still ask doctors to test their nbsp nbsp child s virginity by checking the hymen and the nbsp stretchiness of the vagina but according to nbsp nbsp medical experts, neither of those things tell you nbsp anything about whether that person has had sex. the vagina doesn t permanently stretch out the nbsp first, or any of the times that someone has sex. the va-jay-jay is like a rubber nbsp band it just bounces back. trust me on that one, i birthed two babies. it s also a myth that a person with a vagina nbsp always bleeds or experiences pain the first nbsp nbsp time they have sex. it can happen, but not always. nbsp and it might have nothing to do with the hymen. discomfort can happen for lots of reasons, nbsp including tension, position, speed, nbsp nbsp or not being lubricated enough even nbsp if it s your three-thousandth time. sex doesn t have to be painful, and if it nbsp is, your doctor can help you out with that. all of this is to say virginity is not a medical nbsp reality. there s no physical way of telling nbsp nbsp whether a person has had penis-in-vagina sex not nbsp from the hymen any more than from the earlobe. so if virginity isn t a physical nbsp state of being, what is it think of virginity like money. it s real in nbsp the sense that some people care a lot about it, nbsp nbsp and it impacts our lives i mean, having nbsp sex for the first time is a real experience. and it can be a big moment in someone s nbsp life but the value we assign to virginity nbsp nbsp that s something that cultures have just made up. more specifically, virginity is an nbsp example of a sexual script one of nbsp nbsp the many social expectations about nbsp how to behave when it comes to sex. this idea was first proposed in the 1960s by nbsp sociologists john gagnon and william simon, nbsp nbsp who argued that human sexuality is less driven nbsp nbsp by biological instincts than nbsp the social meanings we create. you can think of scripts like stage nbsp directions in a given time and place. like, if you send me the eggplant nbsp emoji, i m gonna think you re flirting. sexual scripts train people in what s normal or nbsp correct sexual behavior, and they often interact nbsp nbsp with scripts for gender society s nbsp type-cast roles for men and women. on top of that, traditional sexual scripts nbsp in the west are highly heteronormative, nbsp nbsp presuming that only men and nbsp women have sex with each other. oh, and those women sharing a life nbsp together yeah, they re just roommates. like, here s a sexual script you might have heard nbsp before men mainly care about the physical parts nbsp nbsp of sex, and the emotional relationship with nbsp their partner well that s less important. meanwhile, for women, it s all about the emotions. but those traditional scripts aren t for nbsp everybody, and if they don t work for you, nbsp nbsp you can write your own story. especially when nbsp the scripts handed to you do more harm than good. for example, multiple studies have nbsp found that women living in cultures nbsp nbsp that prize virginity are often more reluctant to nbsp nbsp have conversations about sexual health nbsp or access certain types of healthcare. take pap smears. they involve swabbing nbsp the cervix to check for cancerous cells, nbsp nbsp and are recommended for everyone nbsp with a vagina who s over twenty-one. but in cultures that value purity, nbsp some women avoid getting the procedure, nbsp nbsp thinking it ll threaten their status as a nbsp virgin or reveal that they have had p-in-v sex. and like we talked about in episode 4, nbsp nbsp gendered sexual scripts often cast people nbsp in rigid roles they didn t choose. like, that script about men not prioritizing emotional nbsp intimacy that starts developing early, as boys get cast in gender nbsp roles that go something like nbsp nbsp explore be assertive but nbsp don t talk about feelings compare that with the script nbsp traditionally handed to girls nbsp nbsp settle down be careful nbsp think of others feelings growing up with these scripts nbsp can shape our expectations, nbsp nbsp creating miscommunications that make it seem nbsp like men and women are innately different. so different they might as nbsp well be from different planets, nbsp nbsp a claim made by the 1992 book men nbsp are from mars, women are from venus . in it, you ll find statements like men like the nbsp news, the weather, gadgets, gizmos, and uniforms. nbsp nbsp women care about feelings, beauty, relationships, nbsp and wearing a different outfit every day. but these claims aren t well supported by nbsp research. the gender similarities hypothesis, proposed by psychologist janet hyde, nbsp nbsp asserts that men and women are nbsp more alike than they are different. in a study on areas where men and nbsp women are often assumed to part ways, nbsp nbsp like math skills and the gift of gab, hyde nbsp found no statistically significant differences. when it came to sexuality, the nbsp largest gender differences were nbsp nbsp frequency of masturbation and nbsp attitudes toward casual sex. but how much of that ties into sexual scripts some researchers have also pointed nbsp out that boys are taught to touch nbsp nbsp their genitals from an early age nbsp so they can aim while peeing, nbsp nbsp which can lead to more exploration, and more nbsp experience with what feels good to them. for kids your age it s just something normal meanwhile, girls are often taught that their nbsp vulva is something they shouldn t touch. tv test sound effect and can we really talk about attitudes nbsp toward casual sex without addressing the nbsp nbsp virgin script in the room that gendered nbsp double-standard that tells girls it s nbsp nbsp shameful to have sex while telling nbsp boys it s shameful to be a virgin or how about the flip that happens nbsp as we get older, from oh my gosh, nbsp nbsp you re too young to have sex to what nbsp do you mean you haven t done it yet either way, decades of research show that nbsp these narrow scripts are not good for us. the good news is, these scripts don t have to nbsp be your story. your culture hands you a draft, nbsp nbsp not a blueprint of how to live your life. even people who like the traditional script may nbsp nbsp find it limiting at some point like nbsp when a man needs to cry, or a woman nbsp nbsp wants to enjoy some casual sex without nbsp getting branded with a scarlet letter so, go ahead edit them, scribble in the margins, nbsp write your own plot. for years, i was told that nbsp nbsp my first experience of p-in-v sex was bad nbsp because it didn t look like most people s. and it wasn't until i took a nbsp big ol' red marker to the virginity nbsp nbsp script that i was able to own and nbsp appreciate my story. and the more freedom we grant each other to write our nbsp own stories, the better off we all are. so is virginity really a thing well, it isn t a physical absolute, and nbsp it doesn t have any inherent value. it s one of the many scripts our culture hands to us. but those aren t objective truths, and you nbsp get to decide which parts you want to keep, nbsp nbsp and which parts you want to write yourself. next time, we re busting myths nbsp about stis. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was produced nbsp nbsp in partnership with the kinsey nbsp institute at indiana

once participating in a nbsp nbsp shan boooooo chant, i m not sure knew nbsp who i was. but despite that small detail, nbsp nbsp i genuinely believed we were made for each other. and that crush was followed by a cascade nbsp of crushes. when i was a preteen, nbsp nbsp i used to serenade the boy band posters on nbsp my walls. you could say i was boy-obsessed. but why is that why have i always nbsp been into guys instead of girls nbsp nbsp and why are some people into both, or nbsp neither and why does it even matter hi i m shan boooooodram, and nbsp this is crash course sex ed. theme music when i talk about the people that we re into, nbsp i m talking about sexual orientation if men, nbsp nbsp women, neither, or both make you nbsp all sweaty and weak in the knees. sexual orientation might line up with who nbsp someone s actually having sex with, or how they nbsp nbsp publicly identify, or it might not, for lots of nbsp reasons. we talked about that more in episode 1. for now, though, here s the big thing nbsp to know sexual orientation exists nbsp nbsp on a spectrum not just two opposites, nbsp but all the possibilities in-between. so, on one end of the spectrum, if you re nbsp straight, that means you re a woman who s nbsp nbsp exclusively attracted to men, or a man nbsp who s exclusively attracted to women. nbsp nbsp it s the same as being heterosexual, nbsp the prefix hetero meaning other. now, on the other end, if you re lesbian or gay, nbsp you re a woman who s exclusively attracted to nbsp nbsp women, or a man who s exclusively attracted nbsp to men. both can be considered homosexual, nbsp nbsp the prefix homo meaning same although nbsp that term can be seen as dated. but there are tons of other sexual nbsp identities in-between those two, nbsp nbsp often lumped together under nbsp the lgbtqia umbrella. teen shan should i say all the nbsp letters one by one like that nbsp nbsp or should i pronounce it like eljibbitycueaiah shan definitely one by one. we re gonna get into that acronym a bit nbsp later, because it hasn t been around forever. nbsp nbsp but when it comes to all the variation in human nbsp sexuality that s been documented for centuries. diversity in sexuality was the norm in nbsp various cultures across the ancient world, nbsp nbsp from china to egypt to rome. alexander the nbsp great famously had both male and female lovers. but right now, it s illegal to nbsp be gay in sixty-four countries, nbsp nbsp and in twelve of those, it s punishable nbsp by life in prison or even death. and even in countries where being nbsp gay is legal, like the u.s., nbsp nbsp it s not universally accepted. so what happened well, different prejudices around same-sex nbsp intercourse have existed for ages, nbsp nbsp driven by religion and cultural beliefs. nbsp but the fire really sparked soon after nbsp nbsp christianity came to ancient rome, nbsp thanks to scripture prohibiting it. and in the 1200s, christian philosopher nbsp thomas aquinas fanned the flames, nbsp nbsp claiming that same-sex intercourse was against nbsp the natural order of things god had created. this idea that homosexual behavior is nbsp unnatural spread even further as a nbsp nbsp result of christian missionary nbsp work and european colonization. nbsp nbsp and it s been doing damage for nbsp more than eight hundred years. like, flash forward to the 1950s, when nbsp the diagnostic and statistical manual of nbsp nbsp medical disorders, the guide psychiatrists nbsp use to make diagnoses, was first published. it didn t call homosexuality a sin, but it nbsp did carry on the prejudices of the past by nbsp nbsp classifying it as a mental illness. it took nbsp decades for that classification to be undone, nbsp nbsp thanks to a psychiatrist in nbsp disguise. teen shan, let em know. the year was 1972. members of the american nbsp psychiatric association had gathered for their nbsp nbsp annual conference in dallas, texas. several nbsp people sat on a panel about psychiatry and nbsp nbsp homosexuality including someone wearing a nbsp costume and a richard nixon mask dr. anonymous. i am a homosexual, he said into a microphone nbsp that distorted his voice. i am a psychiatrist. nbsp leading up to the conference, lesbian nbsp activists kay tobin lahusen and barbara nbsp nbsp gittings had searched endlessly nbsp for a gay psychiatrist who d be nbsp nbsp willing to speak on the panel to help nbsp destigmatize their own sexuality. but doing so could jeopardize their nbsp careers, so many turned them down. except for dr. john fryer, a gay psychiatrist nbsp nbsp who had lost a residency position nbsp because of his sexual orientation. he agreed to be the voice of gay psychiatrists nbsp on the panel if he could protect his identity. during his speech, he spoke directly to nbsp the closeted psychiatrists in the room, nbsp nbsp saying that though coming nbsp out would be risky, quote, we are taking an even bigger risk nbsp not accepting fully our own humanity, nbsp nbsp with all the lessons it has to teach nbsp all the other humans around us. his speech made an impact the following year, nbsp nbsp homosexuality was removed as nbsp a mental illness from the dsm. and twenty years later, dr. fryer nbsp revealed himself as dr. anonymous. so homosexuality is not a mental illness. but that still doesn t answer our big nbsp question why do we like who we like is it because we re born this way is there a nbsp code in my dna that made me so boy-obsessed well, it s not as simple as that, nbsp nbsp but scientists have found evidence that dna nbsp and sexual orientation seem to be related. they can t say that dna causes nbsp anyone to be gay, straight, nbsp nbsp or anything else but some studies have nbsp found evidence that there is a connection. like, studies that followed identical nbsp twins found that if one twin was gay, nbsp nbsp there was a small, increased likelihood nbsp that the other twin was as well. and big picture, a 2019 study nbsp found that hundreds or even nbsp nbsp thousands of genes may contribute nbsp to a person s sexual orientation, nbsp nbsp and which of those genes gets turned on or off is nbsp probably strongly influenced by internal factors, nbsp nbsp like hormones we re exposed to not just nbsp in the womb, but also later during puberty. so, biology might be part of the story. but it s nbsp nbsp also more complicated than nbsp lady gaga s born this way. one thing we know thanks to sexological nbsp research is that who we re attracted to nbsp nbsp isn t always fixed it can change nbsp and shift throughout our lives. this is called sexual fluidity, and it means nbsp that if you re attracted to one gender now, nbsp nbsp it doesn t mean you could never be nbsp attracted to another gender in the future. and surveys have found that those shifts nbsp might happen for various personal, nbsp nbsp social, or environmental reasons nbsp that aren t related to genetics. that said, evidence shows that sexual nbsp orientation can t be forcibly changed. notably, thousands of young lgbtq people nbsp have undergone conversion therapy nbsp nbsp treatments to try and make them heterosexual. this can involve medication, talk nbsp therapy, humiliation, and much more. but conversion therapy has been renounced by a long list nbsp of medical and psychotherapy associations, nbsp nbsp including the american psychiatric association and nbsp nbsp the american medical association nbsp not only because it s ineffective, nbsp nbsp but because multiple studies have found that nbsp it s associated with mental health risks. ultimately, why we like who we like is nbsp complicated. throughout the centuries, nbsp nbsp the way some societies have viewed nbsp sexual orientation has changed. and so have the ways people have talked about it. which brings us back to that big nbsp ol acronym from the beginning. it started with lg the lesbian and gay nbsp community but has expanded over the years, nbsp nbsp with different identities being acknowledged. the b stands for bisexual. teen shan i know what that means. nbsp it s being attracted to girls and guys. shan well, yes and no. some people see it that way, but others see nbsp bisexuality as encompassing more than the nbsp nbsp gender binary, including attraction nbsp to nonbinary and trans people. and other folks choose to identify as pan- or nbsp omnisexual, pan and omni meaning all. the t and i are for transgender and nbsp intersex , which we nbsp talked about in episode 4. the q has two meanings questioning, nbsp which helps those who may not be sure nbsp nbsp of their sexualities feel welcome in the group. and queer, which is often used today as nbsp an umbrella term for the whole community, nbsp nbsp or as a way of not strictly labeling nbsp someone s sexual orientation. teen shan uh, shan even i know nbsp that word s not cool to say. shan well, good point queer has nbsp been used as a slur in the past, nbsp nbsp though today, many in the community have nbsp reclaimed it as a term for self-identity. but that isn t true everywhere, nbsp nbsp so be careful about using the term, especially nbsp if you don t identify that way yourself. the a stands for asexual. this nbsp term encompasses the ace spectrum, nbsp nbsp people who experience low or no sexual attraction. for example, demisexual people nbsp only experience sexual attraction nbsp nbsp if they re already very close with a person. and finally, you ve got the plus, which nbsp includes all the many additional sexual nbsp nbsp orientations people experience, and nbsp the words they use to describe them. now, this acronym isn t perfect. nbsp some folks think it s too clunky, nbsp nbsp or that it normalizes straightness by lumping nbsp all the other people into one big group. but lots of people find it useful for nbsp building community, especially when nbsp nbsp they re fighting oppression and injustice nbsp against different marginalized identities. as for how many people are in this big ol group nbsp as of 2021, based on census data, the human rights nbsp nbsp campaign estimated that there may be as many as 20 nbsp million lgbtq adults in the united states alone. so yeah, that s why pride parades are so lit. in the end, we might not know exactly why we re nbsp into the people we re into but as a society, nbsp nbsp we ve definitely decided that it matters. once, nbsp people wrote the story that being anything other than straight is wrong, and today, nbsp many others are working hard to unwrite it. because variation in sexual orientation nbsp and behavior has always been around. nbsp nbsp and our understanding of it will just nbsp keep on growing and evolving as we do. next time, we re asking another big question nbsp is virginity even a thing we ll see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was nbsp produced in partnership with the kinsey nbsp nbsp institute at indiana university. if nbsp you re interested in learning more, nbsp nbsp visit their website for resources that explore nbsp the topics we discussed in the video today. thanks for

isn t your home. who you know yourself to be on the inside doesn t nbsp match who people assume you are from the outside. what steps would you take to fix that would nbsp you change your name your clothes your body and which of those steps would be nbsp the one that made you feel like you that s the experience for many nbsp transgender people who are assigned nbsp nbsp a gender at birth that s different nbsp from the way they know themselves. so let s talk about what it nbsp really means to transition. hi i m shan boodram, and nbsp this is crash course sex ed. theme music no matter what color confetti nbsp exploded at their gender reveal party, nbsp nbsp someone s genitals aren t their nbsp destiny. they re also not their nbsp nbsp gender the socially constructed roles nbsp and behaviors often expected of us. and genitals aren t even nbsp the end-all, be-all of sex, nbsp nbsp a classification based on physical traits that nbsp involves genitals, but also hormones and genes. sex is often treated like a fork in the road nbsp male or female, penis or vagina. but in reality, nbsp nbsp the possibilities look a lot more nbsp like a new york city subway map. so, let s take a look at the map the egg and the sperm that made you went nbsp halfsies on all your chromosomes, the bundles nbsp nbsp of dna that make you you. and it s mainly the 23rd nbsp chromosome pair that affects your sex development. from the egg, you get an x nbsp chromosome. and from the sperm, nbsp nbsp you usually get either another x, nbsp making you xx. or a y, making you xy. at about six weeks, an xx embryo usually nbsp starts developing what doctors would nbsp nbsp consider female reproductive organs ovaries, nbsp fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina. and an xy embryo usually has a gene that turns on nbsp like grow a pair. the embryo develops testes, nbsp nbsp those testes start secreting testosterone, nbsp and voila, more male reproductive organs nbsp nbsp a prostate and a penis. there s a whole lot more on nbsp how all this works in crash course biology. notice how i keep saying usually that s nbsp because some people are born intersex nbsp nbsp with a blend of male and female traits, because nbsp of differences in their chromosomes or hormones. like, an xx person might have testes, because nbsp the grow a pair gene that s usually on the y nbsp nbsp was on the x instead. or an xy person might nbsp produce the usual levels of testosterone, nbsp nbsp but have hormone receptors that don t nbsp respond to it with typical male development. there are a lot of different ways someone nbsp can be intersex and those paths are more nbsp nbsp common than you think about seventeen nbsp in every thousand people are born intersex. with about eight billion nbsp people on the planet in 2024, nbsp that s carry the two yeah, 136 million people. teen shan wow, that s more than nbsp three times the population of canada wild, huh but because there s this expectation that nbsp everybody s got either a penis or a vagina, nbsp nbsp intersex people are often put through nbsp medically unnecessary surgeries when nbsp nbsp they re very young so their bodies nbsp look closer to what s deemed normal. in any case, sex is only about the body you re nbsp born with, not the person you become. it s nbsp nbsp mostly about the bits. but as a society, you nbsp might say we re committed to the bits. we use people s anatomy to make assumptions about what nbsp they re like, or how they re supposed to act. and all those socially constructed nbsp ideas swirling around us that s gender. and gender identity is your nbsp inner sense of who you are, nbsp nbsp which could be a man, a woman, nbsp a blend of both, or neither. if you re cisgender, your sex, your gender nbsp identity, and the gender assigned to you nbsp nbsp at birth are the same. but for everyone nbsp else, things aren t so straightforward. a transgender person s gender nbsp identity doesn t match the gender nbsp nbsp they were assigned at birth based on their sex. for example, they were assigned male nbsp but identify as a girl. and a nonbinary nbsp nbsp person s gender identity doesn t nbsp fit neatly into either of the boxes, nbsp nbsp so they opt out of the gender binary altogether. many nonbinary people also identify as nbsp transgender, but that s up to the individual. for some folks, it takes years or even decades to nbsp recognize and put a name to those feelings. but for many, gender identity nbsp starts forming from an early age. i have a three-year-old who s very nbsp curious about anatomy and gender, nbsp nbsp so this conversation comes up a lot in my house. which is typical, because by three or four, nbsp nbsp it s common for both cis and trans kids nbsp to say i m a girl or i m a boy, and to nbsp nbsp prefer same-gender friends, plus clothes nbsp and toys stereotypical for their gender. so even if a trans girl assigned nbsp male at birth is treated like a boy, nbsp nbsp she s still developing an inner sense of girl. nbsp she s paying close attention to social messages nbsp nbsp about what girls like and what girls do messages nbsp like only girls wear dresses and love pink. but especially if you re more of a jumpsuit nbsp gal, or a guy who rocks pink nail polish, nbsp nbsp you ll know that that message only nbsp girls wear dresses and love pink is nbsp nbsp not an objective statement of nbsp reality. it s a gender norm nbsp nbsp a socially constructed idea about how people nbsp of different genders should look and act. gender norms are everywhere, and they can be nbsp strong. a norm can feel as unquestionable as nbsp nbsp gravity, even if it s just a thing people nbsp made up in a certain time and place. like, during the 19th century, dresses were nbsp for anybody under the age of six. see this cutie in a little sundress that s nbsp future president franklin d. roosevelt. even the idea that there are nbsp only two genders also known nbsp nbsp as a gender binary is a norm nbsp that not every culture co-signs. many native american tribes have traditionally nbsp recognized a third gender, often known by the nbsp nbsp pan-tribal term two-spirit, for people nbsp who embody both male and female qualities. many pacific islander cultures also nbsp recognize a third gender like the m h nbsp nbsp in native hawaiian tradition, nbsp meaning the in-between. and in s moa, third and fourth gender people nbsp called fa afafine and fa atama have the special nbsp nbsp role as a family caregiver, including being nbsp someone who can educate others about sex, nbsp nbsp a topic considered taboo for men nbsp and women to discuss publicly. if the idea that there are only two genders feels nbsp normal or natural, it might be because that nbsp nbsp idea was deliberately spread for centuries through nbsp the world s worst road trip european colonialism. while seizing peoples land, colonizers nbsp often suppressed and punished those who nbsp nbsp didn t align with the two genders nbsp europeans thought were correct. so the idea that there are only two genders is nbsp just that an idea that people created to organize nbsp nbsp the world around them. but while putting stuff nbsp in boxes is great when you re moving and have nbsp nbsp to separate your nightstand necessities from your nbsp kitchenware, it usually doesn t work for people. so what happens when the box you re put into nbsp doesn t match who you are on the inside some people act on that feeling by going nbsp through a gender transition choosing nbsp nbsp to live according to their gender nbsp identity which can look like many things. for some, transitioning might look like nbsp changing their name or pronouns. for others, nbsp nbsp it might mean switching up their hair, nbsp their clothes, the way they talk. ash perez i m ashly perez, and i m nbsp a hunky dude. and i m 1 day on t. i m ashly perez, and i m a hunky nbsp dude. and i m 16 weeks on t. shan and some transgender nbsp people but not all might nbsp nbsp choose to transition by making nbsp physical changes to their body. one pathway for that is gender affirming hormone therapy. nbsp nbsp this might involve things like testosterone or nbsp estrogen shots, which trigger physical changes nbsp nbsp similar to puberty, so that someone s body changes nbsp to be more in line with their gender identity. hormone replacement therapy is generally nbsp only prescribed to people over eighteen or nbsp nbsp occasionally, someone in their late teens nbsp who has identified as trans for years, nbsp nbsp with approval from a doctor and their parents. as for young kids before puberty, a trans nbsp kid s transition is primarily social, nbsp nbsp including things like their name, nbsp their pronouns, and their style. however, as puberty approaches, nbsp some trans kids might be prescribed nbsp nbsp a different kind of hormone therapy nbsp medication, called puberty blockers nbsp nbsp medications that pause the changes nbsp that don t align with their gender nbsp nbsp identity things like facial hair, nbsp breast development, or a deeper voice. puberty blockers have been tested and used nbsp safely for decades. and their effects are nbsp nbsp temporary as soon as someone stops nbsp taking them, puberty revs up again. finally, for some people, transitioning nbsp can involve surgery to their face or body, nbsp nbsp to create more masculine or feminine features nbsp that better align with their gender identity. you might hear this called nbsp top or bottom surgery, nbsp nbsp when it involves operating on nbsp someone s chest or genitals. these surgeries have been done on people nbsp of all genders safely for decades like nbsp nbsp how a cisgender woman might get breast nbsp reconstruction surgery after a mastectomy. and although there s a common nbsp myth that trans people often nbsp nbsp regret getting gender-affirming surgery, nbsp research has shown that it s very rare. all of these interventions fall under a holistic nbsp healthcare approach called gender-affirming care, nbsp nbsp which helps folks align their outward nbsp traits with their inner identity. in the vast majority of cases, gender-affirming nbsp care is safe, and it s backed by decades of nbsp nbsp research and by almost every major nbsp medical organization in the u.s., nbsp nbsp including the american medical association nbsp and the american psychological association. gender-affirming care can also be life-saving, nbsp since it can help with the distress many trans and nbsp nbsp nonbinary people feel over the mismatch between nbsp their actual gender and their assigned one. that s called gender dysphoria, nbsp and when it s not addressed, nbsp nbsp it s associated with higher-than-average nbsp rates of mental health conditions and suicide. that said, receiving support and appropriate nbsp medical care can mitigate these risks, nbsp nbsp which suggests that the problem nbsp isn t being trans it s someone nbsp nbsp not being able to live out their gender identity. so there s no one size fits all nbsp way to transition. for some people, nbsp nbsp gender-affirming care simply nbsp means talking to a therapist nbsp nbsp as they navigate transitioning nbsp in social, non-medical ways. trans people have always been nbsp around, and always will be. what s changing is how familiar nbsp people are with various gender nbsp nbsp identities and terms, how governments nbsp are collecting data about trans folks, nbsp nbsp and how easily people can connect nbsp to others with similar identities. that said, in the u.s., we haven t nbsp exactly arrived at the peak of nbsp nbsp empathy and celebrating diverse gender identities. in 2023 alone, u.s. state legislators proposed and nbsp nbsp sometimes passed over five hundred nbsp anti-trans and anti-lgbtq laws. but the more accurate information nbsp is out there, the easier it is to nbsp nbsp base laws and policies on science and nbsp the lived experiences of trans people. and of course, honoring someone's gender identity nbsp nbsp by using the name and pronouns they nbsp choose makes a real difference, too. that word transition might sound like a nbsp moment snaps when somebody becomes who they are. but transitioning looks different nbsp for everyone. it can be messy, nbsp nbsp awkward, and meandering. just nbsp like gender is for a lot of us. because how people experience sex and gender nbsp is way more dynamic than a couple of boxes. next time, we ll talk about sexual orientation or nbsp why we like who we like. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was produced nbsp nbsp in partnership with the kinsey nbsp institute

but this nbsp question and others like it have put nbsp nbsp penises in the spotlight since well, nbsp before spotlights were even invented. ancient civilizations idolized nbsp them. early christians hid them. nbsp nbsp calvin klein ads flaunt them. but when nbsp you turn a body part into a symbol, nbsp nbsp you risk missing out on some nbsp pretty crucial information. so what s the real deal with penises hi i m shan boodram, and nbsp this is crash course sex ed. theme music imagine you re at a massive parade. nbsp we re talking floats, marching bands. and at the end of the procession is nbsp the part we ve all been waiting for nbsp nbsp the arrival of a giant, golden penis this was the vibe of festivals in nbsp ancient greece that honored the nbsp nbsp wine god dionysus. greeks across the nbsp athens-metropolitan-area celebrated nbsp nbsp this symbol of fertility with a nbsp one-night-only hookup extravaganza. and they weren t the only nbsp ones to celebrate penises. the ancient egyptians carved their nbsp gods with larger-than-life erections nbsp nbsp to represent creation. and nbsp the ancient romans believed nbsp nbsp a phallus could ward off the evil eye, nbsp so they put them on all sorts of things. kinda like me and frank s redhot sauce. but when christianity took hold over nbsp much of the world, the vibe changed, nbsp nbsp and it became more common to see the penis nbsp as a symbol of evil and sin. in the 1560s, nbsp nbsp the council of trent launched a campaign nbsp to cover up penises with fig leaves. and many women who were accused of witchcraft nbsp were actually accused of penis-stealing, nbsp nbsp or having knowledge of the devil s penis. hate em or love em, the theme was nbsp the same penises were a big deal. and to some degree, i totally get it. nbsp i think penises are fascinating like, it can just get erect without you telling it to. if you have a penis, you might ve had nbsp your first erection before you were born, nbsp nbsp and you could have your last after you die. you don t see that happen in zombie movies. but if we just think of penises as a symbol nbsp of celebration or sin, we re missing out on nbsp nbsp learning about actual penises, which are pretty nbsp amazing. just not in the parade float kinda way. unlike the vulva and vagina, we ve known nbsp how penises work for a long time. at least, nbsp nbsp once we got past the idea that nbsp erect penises were just full of air. early thinkers were pretty fascinated nbsp by the d, including leonardo da vinci. near the end of the 15th century, nbsp he dissected human cadavers and drew nbsp nbsp elaborate sketches of the penis structure, nbsp becoming the first to note that erections nbsp nbsp are not caused by air, but by nbsp increased blood flow to the penis. and since da vinci s day, our knowledge of the nbsp penis has kept on growing. so let s get into it. while the vulva has different holes nbsp for peeing and sex, the penis has nbsp nbsp just one small hole at the end of it. it s nbsp called the meatus nope, i am not joking , nbsp nbsp and it s the exit for both urine and semen the nbsp fluid that comes out when a person ejaculates. while pee has a relatively straight nbsp shot from the bladder out of the body, nbsp nbsp semen takes more of a scenic route. after being formed in the testicles, mature nbsp sperm travels from a duct called the epididymis nbsp nbsp through a crazy-straw looking tube called nbsp the vas deferens, and eventually into nbsp nbsp another tube called the urethra, before it s nbsp shot out from the meatus during ejaculation. and if the penis pulling nbsp double-duty makes you think, nbsp nbsp uh, shan, doesn t that mean i nbsp might pee during sex don t worry. during arousal, the muscles in the nbsp internal urethral sphincter contract, nbsp nbsp presumably to keep that very thing from happening. now, as for semen you might nbsp assume it s mostly made of sperm, nbsp nbsp but sperm is only two to five nbsp percent of total semen volume. the rest is its entourage of nutrients nbsp and carrier liquid that keep the sperm nbsp nbsp alive and wriggling, and help defend them nbsp against the natural acidity of the vagina. for a full anatomy lesson, you can check nbsp out crash course anatomy amp physiology. but even if you can label a penis diagram nbsp with your eyes closed, there s more to it nbsp nbsp than just the bits and bobs. so, let s grab nbsp some questions from the intimate inbox. oh here s a good one why do i get nbsp an erection while i m sleeping right, so, the penis is mostly nbsp made of a specialized kind of nbsp nbsp tissue with tons of tiny blood vessels in it. when blood flow increases, the penis swells, just nbsp like how a sponge swells when it's full of water. and while this increase in blood nbsp flow can happen when you re aroused, nbsp nbsp it can also happen for seemingly no reason nbsp at all, including when you re asleep. overnight, your body regulates itself nbsp and its blood flow. other than that, nbsp nbsp researchers still don t fully understand why nbsp erections happen during sleep or how often. alright, let s see if i have another one here is it possible to break my penis i m nbsp so scared of breaking my penis. well, i have some great news for you. nbsp even though we use the word boner nbsp nbsp to refer to an erect penis, the human nbsp penis doesn t actually have any bones. that said, if a penis is forcefully bent while nbsp it s erect, the spongy tissue can rupture nbsp nbsp and tear, which can cause lots of pain nbsp and needs immediate medical attention. this is called a penis fracture, but i nbsp can t stress enough that this is not a nbsp nbsp common outcome of sex or masturbation, so it s nbsp not something to lose sleep, or pleasure, over. okay, here s a question from a non-penis-haver. nbsp when i don t want to have sex after making out, nbsp nbsp my boyfriend says he has blue nbsp balls. what does that mean i m so glad you asked this question. nbsp the penis isn t the only organ that nbsp nbsp can swell during arousal. blood flow to nbsp the entire genital area is increased, nbsp nbsp including to the testicles, to nbsp help move semen to the urethra. so if someone gets aroused but doesn t ejaculate, nbsp it can cause a temporary buildup of blood in the nbsp nbsp testicles, which can feel uncomfortable. fun nbsp fact the same thing goes for the clitoris but unless that erection lasts for more nbsp than four hours, which actually is a nbsp nbsp sign of a medical condition, blue nbsp balls aren t in any way dangerous. ejaculating or just waiting for the nbsp arousal to subside will bring relief. nbsp nbsp and if your partner has blue balls, that nbsp isn t something you have to help them with. ok. shan rustling papers well, it looks like all the other questions nbsp nbsp in here are all just the same nbsp question is my penis normal and the short answer to that is probably nbsp i mean, i m not a doctor. but probably if it ever feels like people make a huge nbsp deal out of penis size, you re right. in general, western societies have tended to nbsp associate bigger penises with masculinity, nbsp nbsp fertility, wealth, confidence all sorts of nbsp things that have nothing to do with the actual nbsp nbsp size of someone s genitals, but can do a great job nbsp at making someone feel insecure about themselves. again with the useless symbolism so let s cut to the chase. the best nbsp estimates we have for average penis nbsp nbsp size come from a 2023 paper that analyzed nbsp seventy-five studies and included over nbsp nbsp fifty-five thousand measurements from nbsp different populations around the world. these were the results an average flaccid length nbsp nbsp of 3.4 inches and an average nbsp erect length of 5.5 inches. as for girth, or circumference, nbsp another large study found an average nbsp nbsp flaccid girth of 3.7 inches, and an nbsp average erect girth of 4.6 inches. before you whip out the measuring tape, here s nbsp the thing an average is just an average. there s a significant range on either side of that nbsp middle number that s considered normal. plus, research shows that folks with penises are nbsp the ones who assign size the most importance. one study showed that eight-five percent of nbsp women were satisfied with the size of their nbsp nbsp partner s penis, while only fifty-five percent nbsp of men were happy with what they had goin on. and in most cases, penis size is nbsp pretty unrelated to sexual performance. outside of size, there s a lot of variation nbsp to penises. most are darker than the rest of nbsp nbsp the body and have one tone on the nbsp shaft and one tone on the head. some have visible veins, and some penises are straight while others have a nbsp slight curve to them up, down or to either side. and then there s circumcision. you may nbsp have heard the words cut and uncut nbsp nbsp used to describe circumcised nbsp and uncircumcised penises. that s because circumcision, typically nbsp performed at birth, is a surgery that nbsp nbsp removes the layer of skin covering the nbsp end of the penis, called the foreskin. folks have been performing nbsp circumcisions since ancient times, nbsp nbsp and it s arguably still the most nbsp common surgery performed today. circumcision is chosen for all sorts nbsp of reasons, often as part of cultural nbsp nbsp or religious traditions. and it s nbsp become the norm in some places, nbsp nbsp like the u.s. while it s definitely not nbsp the norm in other places, like the uk. it s hard to say exactly why this is, but it nbsp could ve become cemented in the u.s. healthcare nbsp nbsp system and culture over time, possibly as a nbsp holdover from puritanical attitudes toward sex. puritans used to see circumcision nbsp as a cure for masturbation, nbsp nbsp which they considered unhealthy and sinful. and you might be thinking, but shan, isn t nbsp circumcision more hygienic well, the jury s out on that one. most healthcare experts agree that nbsp there are some minimal benefits and some minimal nbsp nbsp risks associated with circumcision not nbsp enough to firmly recommend either way. in either case, hygiene is a must. the best way nbsp to clean your penis is to pull back the foreskin nbsp nbsp all the way if there is any and wash thoroughly nbsp but gently with your fingers and warm water. you can also use a gentle, unscented soap. so there you have it. penises might have been nbsp the stuff of legend for much of human history, nbsp nbsp but take away all the symbolism, and it turns out nbsp they re just a really cool part of the human body. this is just the start of our foray into penises. nbsp nbsp we ll be talking more about them and nbsp other sex organs in future episodes. speaking of, next time, we ll talk about nbsp what it means to transition. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was

supposed to be shaving my pubic hair these are just a few of the questions nbsp i hear every day as a sex educator. the vulva and the vagina can feel like they re nbsp shrouded in mystery. so let s change that because from the superstar clitoris to nbsp the billions of microorganisms hanging nbsp nbsp out in vaginas, there s a whole lot nbsp of amazing stuff going on down there. hi i m shan boodram, and nbsp this is crash course sex ed. theme music you know how when someone makes a penis nbsp joke, it s usually lighthearted and funny, nbsp but then you go talking about vulvas and nbsp suddenly you re getting a weird side eye no just me here s what i m getting at what s considered nbsp female anatomy can be tangled up with shame. take the word pudendum. it s a medical nbsp term for genitals that usually refers to nbsp nbsp the vulva amp associates, and it comes from nbsp a latin word that means to be ashamed. and that matters. not just because we re stigmatizing anatomy nbsp that roughly half the population has, nbsp nbsp but also because studies have shown that nbsp people who felt bad about their vulva and nbsp nbsp vagina were less likely to enjoy sex, or nbsp seek medical care when they needed it. this shame has also influenced how nbsp much we know about the vagina and co. most of our modern understanding nbsp of sexual anatomy has been shaped nbsp nbsp by centuries of male-dominated thinking nbsp and research much of which was conducted nbsp nbsp without the input of women, or nbsp anyone who wasn t a cisgender man. even a bunch of female organs are named after nbsp the male scientists who discovered them. like, nbsp nbsp fallopian tubes named after gabriele nbsp falloppio, who famously, didn t have any. here s the deal, labias and genitals the nbsp better we understand how all bodies work, nbsp nbsp the better off we are. so, let s get into it. first things first all this is not the vagina. everything you can see from nbsp the outside is the vulva. the technical term for this area nbsp above the vulva is the mons pubis. these two outer lips are the labia majora. then nbsp nbsp you have the inner lips the labia nbsp minora and within them, two holes. this teeny one at the end of the urethra is the nbsp urethral opening, which is where urine comes out, nbsp nbsp and this middle one down here is the vaginal nbsp opening, which is the doorway to the vagina. the vagina is that inner canal beyond the nbsp vaginal opening and that s it. vulva, external vagina, internal. when there s nothing inside a vagina, nbsp it s more of a flat envelope than a nbsp nbsp gaping tunnel. it s an average nbsp of just over two inches long. but during arousal it can expand nbsp nbsp up to eight inches to make room for nbsp whatever it is you ve got going on. meanwhile, on the outside, the nbsp vulva extends all the way down here. this space of delicate tissue between the vaginal nbsp opening and the anus is called the perineum. you can learn more about these parts nbsp in crash course anatomy amp physiology. but for now, let me introduce you nbsp to this superstar the clitoris. it s tucked under the clittoral hood, nbsp but don t let its size fool you. the part that we can see is nbsp just the tip of the iceberg. the clitoris is actually a large, nbsp complex structure that extends inside the pelvic cavity, nbsp nbsp and it s made up of the same kind of nbsp spongy erectile tissue as the penis. its full structure wasn t uncovered nbsp until 2005 and this time, by a woman nbsp nbsp australian urologist helen o connell. keep in mind, the penis was fully nbsp anatomically described as early as 35 bce, nbsp nbsp so the clitoris has been waiting nbsp a long time for the spotlight. the clitoris has over 10,000 nerve nbsp endings, and one of its main purposes nbsp nbsp is sexual pleasure, hence the superstar status. we ll talk more about it in future episodes. but for now, let s answer some questions nbsp from the intimate inbox. i ll do the honors. alright, the first question my nbsp vulva doesn t look like the one nbsp nbsp on the poster in my health class. nbsp is there something wrong with it you know what most people s nbsp vulvas do not look like that. the inner lips can be longer than the outer lips. nbsp nbsp both sets of labia can be nbsp different sizes or lengths. your pubic hair can be bushy nbsp , wispy, curly, or straight. your clitoris might be smaller or larger, and all of this diversity as long as you re nbsp nbsp not in pain or something s affecting nbsp your quality of life is normal. you might trim, shave, or wax your pubic hair nbsp nbsp for personal comfort or for nbsp intimacy, or you might not there s no right way to landscape your nbsp lawn, if you know what i m saying. alright, here s another one. why is my nbsp skin down there darker than the rest of me that s totally normal, too everyone s skin has melanin in it, nbsp the pigment that gives skin its color. around your genitals, these pigment-producing nbsp cells are super sensitive to hormones, nbsp nbsp and our hormones are really active in these areas. when the two interact, they create nbsp more pigment. simple as that. what s with all the wetness you might have heard that when nbsp someone with a vulva gets aroused, nbsp nbsp they get wet. and that s true during sexual arousal more nbsp blood flows to the genital area. that makes these two little glands here and these nbsp nbsp two little glands here release fluid nbsp to lubricate the vaginal opening. think of it as a natural lube. nbsp fluid decreases friction, nbsp nbsp and just generally makes it easier for nbsp things to slide in and out of the vagina. but listen, vaginas get wet nbsp for all sorts of reasons. one of the most common ones the big d discharge. if you ve ever looked in your nbsp underwear and been like, uhhhhh, nbsp nbsp what is that it s probably discharge, nbsp which is the vagina s wash cycle. the vagina cleans itself by shedding old cells, nbsp nbsp and it keeps the tissue healthy nbsp and protected with moisture. vaginas produce around a half to a full nbsp teaspoon of discharge every day, but the nbsp nbsp fluid and the amount of it varies from person nbsp to person and throughout the menstrual cycle. some of that discharge is from the nbsp glands we talked about earlier, nbsp nbsp but some is also produced by the cervix nbsp where the vagina ends and the uterus begins. really, though, the only time you nbsp should worry about discharge is nbsp nbsp if it s different from your normal nbsp like if it s green-ish or foamy, nbsp nbsp has blood in it when it s not nbsp your period, or smells off. in those cases, do consider nbsp talking to your doctor. sometimes my discharge smells not nbsp bad, but kinda funky. why is that great question to find out, let s nbsp take a trip inside the vagina. believe it or not, everyone s nbsp genitals are covered in microbes, nbsp nbsp including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. but nbsp don t panic that s actually a good thing the vagina is home to its own magnificent nbsp world of microorganisms, mostly bacteria, nbsp nbsp and they re an essential part of nbsp keeping things safe and healthy. this invisible community is nbsp called the vaginal microbiome. now, the research into all of this is pretty nbsp new, so there s still a lot that we don t know. and many studies have largely nbsp focused on white, western women, nbsp nbsp though new research shows that the makeup of nbsp the vaginal microbiome varies by ethnicity. but here s what we do know the typical vaginal microbiome is mostly made nbsp up of a kind of bacteria called lactobacillus. it s the same genus of bacteria nbsp that s found in yogurt and cheese, nbsp nbsp but it s not the exact same species. these bacteria produce lactic acid, nbsp nbsp which keeps the vaginal environment nbsp on the acidic end of things. now, if you ve ever noticed that nbsp the crotch of your underwear nbsp nbsp wears out fast and gets bleached, nbsp that s because of the lactic acid. the vagina is usually between nbsp a 3.8 and a 5 on the ph scale, nbsp nbsp which puts it somewhere between the nbsp acidity of wine vinegar and cucumbers. this keeps yeast and other kinds nbsp of local bacteria in check. okay, back to the smell question. nbsp everyone, especially people with vaginas, nbsp nbsp face a lot of social pressure nbsp to look and smell a certain way. how stuff smells down there depends nbsp on what s going on with the vaginal nbsp nbsp microbiome, which is heavily affected by hormones. both semen and menstrual blood can nbsp also throw off the vagina s ph, nbsp nbsp because they re more basic. meaning the opposite nbsp of acidic, not like, pumpkin spice latte basic. that said, if things smell fishy down there nbsp nbsp that could be a sign that the nbsp microbiome is out of balance. but here s the great news while vulvas benefit from a nice wash with nbsp warm water, vaginas are self-cleaning. you never need to use soap or any other nbsp kind of cleaning product inside your vagina. it s cliterally bad for you, because your ph nbsp can be thrown off if you disturb it too much. and, when the microbiome is out of whack, that can nbsp lead to inflammation, discomfort, and pain. overall, just like with discharge, the nbsp only time you should worry about how nbsp nbsp your vagina smells is if it s nbsp different from your normal. vulvas, vaginas, and everything that nbsp goes with them are pretty amazing. and they re worth talking about and nbsp studying so that we can understand nbsp nbsp them just like any other part of the human body. and when it comes to what s normal if you have a vulva, the most important nbsp thing is learning what s normal for you, nbsp nbsp to keep your body healthy, nbsp safe, and feelin in flow. next time, we re turning the nbsp spotlight on penises. see you then. this episode of crash course sex ed was produced nbsp nbsp in partnership with the kinsey nbsp institute at indiana university. if you are interested in learning more, nbsp nbsp visit their website for resources that explore nbsp the topics
